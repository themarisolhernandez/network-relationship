However, for some adolescents, specifically adolescents who have an avoidant state of mind in regards to attachment, romantic relationships and particularly intimacy is an experience they may find challenging. Given the importance of intimacy in an adolescent’s life, this study proposes to investigate whether the quality of peer relationships can influence romantic intimacy among adolescents with an avoidant attachment. Friendship quality was chosen as a mediating variable in the present study to examine if the quality of peer relationships positively influences the relationship between avoidant attachment and romantic intimacy among adolescents. Specifically, the present study aims to answer the following research questions: (1) Is avoidant attachment linked to the quality of peer relationships among adolescents? (2) Do peer relationships mediate the relationship between avoidant attachment and romantic intimacy among adolescents? While it is known that avoidant attachment negatively impacts romantic intimacy, there is contradicting evidence suggesting that attachment influences the quality of peer relationships (Boling et al., 2011; Ducharme et al., 2002; Groh et al., 2014; Kerns, 1996; Markiewicz et al., 2001; Schwarz et al., 2012). Some studies show that individuals with an avoidant attachment tend to have difficulty creating and maintaining satisfactory peer relationships and friendships while other studies found no evidence that attachment impacts peer relationships or friendship quality (Boling et al., 2011; Kerns et al., 1996; Schwarz et al., 2012). This study will investigate whether adolescents with an avoidant attachment have poorer quality of peer relationships and whether peer relationships have a positive effect on the relationship between avoidant attachment and romantic intimacy in adolescence. This study will analyze data collected from the National Institute of Child Health and Development – Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. Structural equation models will be used to test the possibility of quality of peer relationships as a mediator for the relationship between avoidant attachment and romantic intimacy.",Educational and School Psychology,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4786&context=uop_etds,2022,6.731778,-10.259554,EFFECTS OF PEER RELATIONSHIPS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AVOIDANT ATTACHMENT AND ROMANTIC INTIMACY AMONG ADOLESCENTS,"Johnson, S."

In the first part of the study, two pairs of alanine (A)-based isomeric peptides consisting of a basic probe, lysine (Lys) or 2,3-diaminopropionic acid (Dap), were investigated to understand the nature of the enhanced basicity when the basic probe was moved from the N-terminus to the C-terminus.  In the second part of the study, alanine-based peptides containing a cysteine (C) as the acidic probe were investigated to understand the chirality effects on the gas-phase acidity by altering the chiral centers systemically.  Previous studies by mass spectrometry showed that the peptides ALys and AADap have had remarkably higher proton affinity (PA) compared to their isomeric counterparts LysA and DapAA.  In this work, conformations, energetics, and molecular properties of the peptide systems have been thoroughly characterized through infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy and quantum chemical computations utilizing a set of molecular modeling tools.  The molecular properties include charge distribution, dipole moment, torsional strain, hydrogen bonding, and non-covalent interaction.  Computational studies yielded the lowest energy conformations along with their theoretical infrared (IR) spectra for each of the peptide systems.  The resulting theoretical proton affinities are in excellent agreement with experiments.  The results also suggest that the relative stability of the protonated peptides is the main source of the difference in the gas-phase basicity between the isomeric peptides.  Structurally representative conformations for the protonated peptides were identified by matching the theoretical IR spectra to the corresponding IRMPD spectra.  The band features of the IRMPD spectra were analyzed in detail by vibrational mode decomposition.  The N-probe peptide ions, LysAH+ and DapAAH+, adopt diverse backbone geometries and intramolecular hydrogen bonding networks, and rely heavily on the hydrogen bonds for conformational stabilization.  In contrast, the C-probe peptide ions, ALysH+ and AADapH+, adopt helical conformations, and benefit from the interaction between the helix macrodipole and the charged NH3+  group.  The low torsional strain on the Lys sidechain contributes significantly to the conformational stability for ALysH+ than for LysAH+.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4785&context=uop_etds,2022,-14.534559,-6.68535,GAS-PHASE ACID-BASE PROPERTIES AND CONFORMATIONS OF OLIGOPEPTIDES THROUGH MASS SPECTROMETRY AND COMPUTATIONAL STUDIES,"Zhang, Y."

Ball,"Goal-setting, List recall, Memory, Performance feedback, Strategy use, Task Commitment, Cognitive psychology","Strategy instruction can improve memory performance, but some training programs are more effective than others. Some scholars propose that a key element to boosting the benefits from training programs is enhancing or emphasizing self-regulatory factors, such as knowledge about memory, beliefs about ability, or motivational factors. Research supporting this claim evidence adds that programs that enhance trainees’ confidence in their abilities improve memory performance and that multifactorial programs are more effective than strategy-training-only programs. Setting performance goals and receiving feedback are two self-regulatory factors known to relate to memory performance that may sometimes be included in some training programs. However, previous research has not directly compared the effectiveness of strategy instruction with and without goal-setting and performance feedback elements. This was the purpose of the present research: We compared strategy instruction with goal-setting and positively-framed feedback across three assessments of memory performance, strategy use, and task commitment. Participants were 48 university students who were randomly assigned to two conditions: All participants watched a brief memory strategy video, but participants in the Strat+GFB condition set goals for their memory performance and received positively-framed objective performance feedback and participants in the StratOnly condition did not. Research assistants conducted the experimental procedures individually with participants in 1-hour-long Zoom video calls. Primary outcome measures (memory performance, strategy use, and task commitment) were assessed three times, once before and twice after strategy instruction, with or without goal-setting and feedback between each test, depending on condition assignment. Shopping list recall tests were used to assess memory performance, and the number of to-be-recalled stimuli increased at each testing occasion as 15 additional items were added at each trial. Participants recalled more items, but a smaller percentage of the items, over time, and this pattern was not different for the experimental conditions. Additionally, number of strategies used, as self-reported on a retrospective checklist, increased from before to after strategy instruction. Importantly, the Strat+GFB condition maintained levels of commitment to the memory tests across the three trials, whereas the StratOnly condition reported drops in their task commitment. Study results emphasize that including self-regulatory factors, such as setting goals and receiving feedback, may increase commitment to a task, however those benefits may not immediately translate to better memory performance when training and testing is part of a brief, single experimental session. We suggest that future research evaluate a multiday memory intervention with the addition of goal-setting and feedback. Results of this study suggest that including goal-setting and feedback as part of a training program may benefit trainees’ commitment, which we speculate could aid individuals in maintaining persistent effort despite challenges and ultimately lead to better performance over a longer term.",Educational and School Psychology,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4777&context=uop_etds,2021,6.4683146,-8.996793,"Memory Strategy Instruction With Goal-Setting And Positive Feedback Impact On Memory, Strategy Use, and Task Commitment","Ball, M."

However, for some individuals, requests to transition may occasion problem behavior which can interfere with daily routines and result in a more restrictive lifestyle. The unpredictability of transitions is often assumed to be aversive and functionally related to transition-related problem behavior. As a result, advance notice procedures are often recommended to reduce problem behavior during transitions. However, Brewer et al. (2014) found mixed results for the use of advance notice highlighting some studies where advance notice procedures reduced problem behavior and others where the procedures were inefficacious.

Next, we identified key features of each study, including the presence or absence of demonstrated functional relations, inclusion of additional antecedent or consequent interventions, and evaluation and control of the effects of pre- and post-transition reinforcers on responding.

The accuracy of the Wirele-X and the Root ZX II (J. Morita, Tokyo, Japan) was compared in vitro using an alginate model.   Materials/Methods: Thirty-one extracted single-rooted human teeth with mature apices were decoronated at the CEJ. Under 10X magnification, actual canal lengths (ACL) were determined. The teeth were embedded in alginate and electronic canal length measurements were obtained using the Root ZX II and Wirele-X EALs. Each tooth was measured three times with both EALs. A blinded examiner measured each file with a digital micrometer to the nearest 0.01 mm. Differences between ACLs and the average measurements from the EALs were compared with Student's t test for related samples.   Results: The average distance from the file tip to the apical foramen (AF) was -0.11 mm (±0.16) and -0.07 mm (±0.21) for the Root ZX II and Wirele-X systems, respectively.

Cardona,"Communication, Education, Higher education, Diversity, Equity, Higher Education, Inclusion, Intercultural Communication, Social Media","This study seeks to understand the effects and levels of impact that a university student’s intercultural communication competence, social media usage, and self-esteem have on the students’ attitudes towards diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts implemented by institutions of higher education. By studying these three independent variables, this research seeks to improve the understanding of the university students’ attitudes on DEI efforts for leaders and change agents in higher education, providing an inspiration for leaders, administrators, and change agents of higher education to continue collaborating to innovate methods and avenues towards creating a diverse, equitable, and inclusive campus climate, as well as focusing on the roles that intercultural communication competence, social media usage, and self-esteem play in this construction of DEI programming. The researcher administered a questionnaire to 351 undergraduate, graduate, and professional students from the University of the Pacific Stockton, Sacramento, and San Francisco campuses using various scales examining campus DEI climate, intercultural communication competency levels, self-esteem, and university-specific and general social media usage. The data from the surveys were analyzed to determine how the independent variables influence the students’ attitudes towards the DEI efforts being implemented by their university. The results indicate that self-esteem (SE) (r= 0.30) and students’ satisfaction with the university’s DEI-related social media campaigns and content (SSPDEI) (r= 0.38) are strongly correlated with the students’ attitudes towards the university’s commitment to DEI. Although intercultural communication competence (ICC) (r= 0.20) and how students use university- affiliated social media (USEPSM) (r= 0.21) offer levels of influence on the students’ attitudes towards the university’s commitment to DEI, they lag behind the levels shown by SE and SSPDEI. The results indicate that the students’ satisfaction with the university’s DEI-related social media campaigns and content (SSPDEI) (r= 0.35) provides a significant correlation with the students’ feelings towards diversity, equity, and inclusion on the campus (DEISF). Although ICC (r= 0.20), SE (r= 0.20), and USEPSM (r= 0.19) offer levels of influence on the DEISF, they lag behind the level shown by SSPDEI. The results also indicate that the student’s satisfaction with the university’s DEI-related social media campaigns and content (SSPDEI) (r= 0.28) and self-esteem (SE) (r= 0.23) provide the greatest influence on evidence-based DEI (DEIEV), which includes the student’s feelings and beliefs about the university’s commitment to non- discrimination and respect of each student’s individual qualities and demographics. Although ICC (r= 0.19) and USEPSM (0.16) offer levels of influence on DEIEV, they lag behind the level shown by SSPDEI and SE. Intercultural Communication Competency, Self Esteem, and Social Media Usage all have a significant positive relationship with a student’s attitude towards the DEI efforts being implemented by their university. A regression analysis found that the variables of self-esteem and intercultural communication competency have a strong predicting effect on any variances that are seen in the students’ attitudes toward the university’s commitment to DEI. The students’ use of social media may provide enough positive effect on the student’s attitudes towards the university’s efforts and actions related to DEI, however, the focus should then be placed on student satisfaction with the overall strategy and implementation.

If left uncorrected, the malocclusion can lead to periodontal issues, tooth fractures, tooth loss, or other significant dental problems. Utilization of microimplants in palatal expansion aims to correct transverse discrepancies between the maxilla and mandible by separating the palatal suture in a parallel manner aimed at maximizing skeletal changes and minimizing dental side effects. Overlying soft tissue changes can be affected by the induced skeletal changes. The purpose of this study is to evaluate skeletal expansion and the overlying soft tissue change that occurs using MARPEs (microimplant assisted rapid palatal expanders) at the end of orthodontic treatment in skeletally mature (Cervical Vertebral Maturation (CMV) ≥ 5) patients using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging and to evaluate soft tissue changes that occur at the time of orthodontic treatment completion using CBCT imaging. Materials and Methods: CBCT scans from 19 patients who were treated using microimplant assisted rapid palatal expanders were traced and evaluated at three time points: Before orthodontic treatment (T1), post MARPE expansion with MARPE in place (T2), and after orthodontic treatment with MARPE removed. Fourteen hard tissue landmarks and six soft tissue landmarks in the midface and nasal cavity regions were traced by three judges at each time point. The traced landmark points were averaged among all three judges and comparisons were made between the three time points to see the amount of expansion that occurred at various anatomical 2 regions. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to evaluate inter-judge reliability for all measurements. A repeated measures ANOVA test was used for statistical comparison across all three time points and a Tukey post hoc test was used for comparison between time points. Significance was set to .05 and ICC was set to >.70. Results: Expansion with microimplant assisted rapid palatal expanders can affect the hard tissue of the midface region as well as the overlying soft tissue. Increases in skeletal width from the ANS down to the maxillary alveolar bone were statistically significant in both the short term (T1-T2) and long term (T1-T3). The nasal cavity width at inferior turbinate area increased significantly after expansion (T2) and remained increased at treatment completion (T3) and the increased soft tissue width of the alar base that presented after expansion therapy remained increased at treatment completion. Conclusion: Maxillary expansion with microimplant assisted expanders resulted in skeletal changes throughout the maxilla and led to a significant long-term increase in nasal cavity width. The soft tissue changes associated with MARPE treatment show that a widening of the base of the nose may be expected after expansion and can remain at treatment completion.",Dentistry,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1021&context=dugoni_etd,2021,-15.03182,7.270027,1 Long Term Impact of Microimplant Assisted Rapid Palatal Expansion on Soft Tissue Nasal Morphology,"Chew, L."

The researcher categorized responses into the following themes: gender expression, relationships, acceptance and representation, resources for students, training for educators, and policy. The researcher found through the experience, knowledge, and perspectives of these four special education staff that students can freely express their gender identity in school and have mostly positive relationships with their peers and school staff. Special education and school staff generally accept students with these dual identifiers in schools, but rarely represent them in curriculum.

Contreras,"CrossFit, Fitness Industry, Instagram, Social Comparison, Thin Ideal, Marketing","Over the last 15 years there has been a dynamic shift within the fitness industry, particularly for women.  For decades, women were expected to participate in aerobic-based workouts and maintain a thin figure.  This thin ideal has been harmful to women and contributed to low levels of self-esteem.  CrossFit diverges from aerobics by encouraging strength training and teaching women that workouts can be functional, and beauty does not only lie in one’s aesthetics.  The emergence and growth of CrossFit is shifting fitness-related gender norms and expectations, and possibly contributing to higher levels of self-esteem in women.  This shift has become more apparent and visible though the growth of social networking sites like Instagram.  Since Instagram is a photo- and video-based platform, there are significant opportunities for social comparison.  Therefore, researchers should attempt to better understand how women in CrossFit engage with Instagram, and more specifically, how social comparison mediates self-esteem.  This research gained insight into CrossFit—a fitness program dominating worldwide and challenging harmful social norms for women within the fitness industry—by examining how women CrossFitters engage in social comparison on Instagram.  This research fills a much-needed gap because there is a lack of research on women CrossFitters, Instagram, and social comparison.  The researcher administered a survey consisting of seven scales and 72 questions throughout the greater Sacramento area measuring social comparison habits, self-esteem, superiority, and Instagram use among women CrossFitters.

Recent technological advancements have led to the development of fully automated landmark identification (ALI) systems capable of tracing Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of an ALI system as a tool for automatic landmark location compared to human judges. Methods: One hundred subjects’ CBCT volumes from multiple imaging centers were traced by two human judges who were calibrated and had an ICC close to 1. Fifty-three landmarks were identified in the x, y, and z coordinate planes using Checkpoint Software (Stratovan Corporation, Davis, CA). The ground truth was created by calculating the mean values of the x, y, and z coordinates for each landmark across both judges’ landmark identification. To evaluate the accuracy of ALI, the mean absolute error at each coordinate and mean error distance (mm) between the human landmark identification (ground truth) and the ALI were determined, and a successful detection rate (SDR) was calculated. Results: Overall, the ALI system was as successful at landmarking as the human judges with the exception of a few landmarks. The mean error distance for all 53 landmarks was 4.04 mm ± 6.5. Forty-nine out of 53 landmarks were located within a mean error of 4mm when the average for the coordinates of human judges was considered as a ground truth. Conclusion: Across all three coordinate planes, 96% of the landmarks had a mean absolute error of less than 4mm when compared to the ground truth. The ALI was more precise than humans when identifying landmarks on the same image at different times.

We will systematically explore the hypothesis that an early interceptive treatment protocol using removable appliances provides the same treatment outcome but better cost-effectiveness than a traditional fixed-appliance protocol. Methods: Interim data on a prospective study with patients being treated either in private practice with rational fixed Phase I orthodontic treatment (n=11) or in a community clinic with removable interceptive orthodontic treatment (n=10). Initial and post treatment study models were acquired along with pretreatment PAR and clinical photos. PAR and ICON scores were assessed on all initial and final casts. Cost effective analyses were performed comparing the two treatment groups as well as comparing the removable group to no treatment. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of our data while manipulating certain treatment outcome variables. Results: For the fixed group the average PAR score at T2 was 7.6 with a 68% reduction from T1 to T2, while the ICON average score was 16.2 with a 67% reduction. In the removable group the average PAR score at T2 was 13.4 with a lesser reduction from T1 to T2 than the fixed group at 48% (p=0.20), while the ICON average score was 25.3 with a significantly lower reduction of 39% when compare to the fixed group (p=0.037). Cost effectiveness analyses showed that the removable appliance treatment protocol was cost effective when compared to no treatment but not cost effective when compared to 3 the traditional fixed Phase I treatment using the studies measured probabilities of success.

Objective: The objective of this study was to determine whether the abridged criteria of the EndoCase application can help predict the incidence of procedural errors in nonsurgical root canal treatment of mandibular molars in an undergraduate dental clinic based on the difficulty level. Methods: A list of patients who received primary root canal treatment on mandibular first molars in the undergraduate dental clinic from 2015-2020 was obtained. Ninety patients qualified for inclusion. Case difficulty level was assessed using the ECA by three providers with differing levels of experience. Incidence of procedural errors was determined from post-operative radiographs by two calibrated independent observers. Results: The most common endodontic mishaps were errors during access cavity preparation followed by the presence of voids in the root filling, with an incidence of 54.4% and 45.6%, respectively. There were no significant differences regarding case difficulty level and the incidence of total procedural errors nor number of treatment visits. Of the individual error types, the presence of obturation >2mm short of the radiographic apex was weakly correlated with case difficulty level (r = 0.226, pConclusion: There is minimal correlation between the difficulty level of mandibular molars determined by the ECA and the number of treatment visits or overall incidence of procedural errors.",Dentistry,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&context=dugoni_etd,2021,-14.086339,6.25988,Utilization of a new web-based application for case difficulty assessment as a predictor for procedural errors in nonsurgical root canal treatment,"Hasanat, W."

While higher education heavily invests in preparing graduates to think critically and lead successfully, research shows an increasing number of students display low-stress resiliency and risk-aversion while struggling to cope with challenge and failure pre-and post-graduation. This study, conducted at faith-based Christian universities during the COVID-19 pandemic, used grounded theory to generate a generalizable leadership stress resilience model that explains: (a) Why and how undergraduate student leaders experience stress; (b)The influence of stress on student leaders at faith-based institutions; (c)The various processes and strategies student leaders employ to resolve their main concerns regarding the impact and consequences of stress; and (d) The role faith plays, if any, in how student leaders cope with stress. This study informs student leadership development for higher education professionals in the critical area of stress resilience and reveals insights into the formative role faith has on leaders, particularly the influence of faith on leadership stress coping. Three meta-themes of student leader expectations, processing student leadership stress, and the role personal authentic faith played in developing stress resilience versus an obligatory faith that compounded stress emerged.

Due to the energetic and thermoregulatory constraints of molting and the large distances between their coastal rookeries and foraging grounds, elephant seals must remain on land and fast for the duration of their molt. Previous studies of molting northern elephant seals have examined endocrine and metabolic adjustments to fasting, but not the molecular processes underlying molting. We examined changes in the skin and underlying blubber tissues using histological, endocrine, and proteomic analyses during molting to provide a more in-depth understanding of the cellular mechanisms enabling rapid skin shedding and regeneration in this marine mammal. Shotgun proteome sequencing by LC-MS/MS identified 47,671 peptides and 573 protein groups in skin and outer blubber that were associated with lipid metabolism, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, and collagen regulation. Label-free quantification and differential protein expression analyses identified 23 and 21 proteins that were differentially expressed during molting in the skin and outer blubber, respectively. Proteins downregulated over molting included those associated with inflammation, angiogenesis, and cellular proliferation, whereas proteins upregulated over molting included those associated with cytoskeletal remodeling, collagen synthesis, and lipid metabolism. This suggests that rapid skin regeneration involves intensive protein synthesis and increased vascularization that may be supported by fatty acid substrates from underlying blubber tissue. These data provide insights into cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern unusually rapid skin regeneration in mammals, which may further understanding of disorders affecting the skin and hair of humans and other mammals.",Biological Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4742&context=uop_etds,2021,-17.84362,-13.048151,Molecular Responses to Catastrophic Molting in a Wild Marine Mammal,"Keith, A."

The scope of this research focuses on low-socioeconomic status (SES) urban youth, so cultural sensitivity is naturally always a component of a complete train-the-trainer, trauma-informed teaching program. I identified the emerging best practices in two ways: (a) by gathering and summarizing supporting sources of literature and (b) by holding collaborative conversations with acknowledged experts in culturally competent trauma-informed training. The findings revealed six components essential to prepare the trainer on trauma-informed education training. First, culturally responsive pedagogy and culturally responsive teaching were identified to aid in bridging the gap in providing support. Social capital based upon lived experiences of students was recognized by acknowledging their needs through appropriate modeling of positive attitudes and behavior while increasing confidence in student learning using inclusive resources demonstrated throughout academic content. Next, the key principles of brain science were acknowledged showing a relationship between impact of trauma and learning affects such as: processing, decoding, self-regulation, and impulse control. Then, mental health was addressed to show there is an impact of negative interactions and disciplinary actions, according to Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) ecological systems theory. Attitude and language were acknowledged as both verbal and non-verbal and having an impact on instructional behavior, which influences student climate in learning and behavior.

They have been shown to be effective in treating a variety of important human diseases. Since human insulin was approved as the first recombinant protein therapeutic, this field has experienced rapid growth. One of the biggest challenges for protein therapeutics in clinical application is their short half-life. Except for monoclonal antibodies, which have serum half-life for weeks, most of the protein therapeutics have half-lives ranging from minutes to hours. Kidney filtration, proteasome degradation and liver metabolism are the main factors that attribute to their short half-lives. The short half-life of protein therapeutics requires a higher dose or frequent application to maintain therapeutic concentration over a certain period. However, higher dose is easy to cause large plasma concentration fluctuation, which is easy to cause side effects. Most of protein therapeutics are not orally bioavailable. Frequent application will increase the burden of patients, affect their life quality, and reduce patient compliance. Thus, it is important to generate long-lasting therapeutics with improved pharmacokinetic properties. The current half-life extension approaches for protein therapeutics include PEGylation, albumin fusion or binding and fusion to an immunoglobulin Fc region. Their primary aim is to increase the size of biotherapeutics or to implement recycling by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). However, the half-life extension by PEGylation, albumin fusion or Fc fusion is at the cost of binding affinity reduction. And the increase of size has limited their application in the field of anticancer agents where tumor penetration is required. Noncovalent albumin binding using albumin binding ligands such as fatty acids could maintain the small size and binding affinity. However, it would increase hydrophobicity, therefore is not suitable for protein therapeutics with low solubility. Here, we present a new approach for half-life extension for biotherapeutics. Human interleukin 2 (IL-2), a low solubility cytokine, was used as a model protein. By conjugating IL-2 with a hydrophilic small molecule that binds reversibly to the serum protein transthyretin, we enhanced its circulation half-life in rodents while maintained its in vitro bioactivity.

Culturally competent teachers, cultural humility, and culturally relevant pedagogy are a few of the ways educators can adapt to the change in student demographics.  Linking the literature to these findings will help provide an overview of several factors associated with teacher cultural competency and student academic performance.  Included in the research are classroom demographics, cultural bias, teacher education and experience, relational capacity, and culturally relevant pedagogy.  The research suggests that the more teachers are aware of their own bias through culturally competent teacher education, the more successful teachers are at reaching diverse students in the classroom.

Male student athletes’ inappropriate tweets have become such a problem for universities, athletic departments, and the NCAA that coaches are forced to place a ban on their players’ social media usage or hire third party monitoring systems.   Unfortunately, these reactive responses have not alleviated the problem of  athletes differentiating what content is appropriate or inappropriate to tweet on their Twitter accounts.  Analysis of the data collected from scholarly journal articles, textbooks, and popular press articles revealed that social media education would be the most effective prevention method to lessen student athletes’ inappropriate tweets.  This project uses Dr. Mark Robinson’s approach to Personal Player Development in constructing its two resources—multimedia workshops and an interactive Canvas site.  The purpose of this project is for student athletes to be more aware of their social media content by knowing how to post appropriate tweet messages on their personal Twitter accounts in order to enable athletes, especially men, to comprehend why certain tweet messages are classified as inappropriate and, therefore, should never be made public.

The similarity in light conditions between the canopy and understory strata at edges or disturbed habitat is hypothesized to be responsible for this phenomenon. We conducted a study using standardized sampling to document and quantify this edge effect, characterize edge and forest strata, and estimate the relative contributions of temperature and light conditions on nymphalid stratification.

Methods: In the first portion of this study, 97 patients who started treatment prior to July 2020 and who had MARPE expander treatment at the University of the Pacific were included. Chart review and evaluation of progress clinical photographs were used to report the following complications: inflammation, pain, appliance malfunction, broken microscrew, and pulpitis. In the second portion of this study, 77 patients from a private practice orthodontist who started treatment prior to January 2021 were included in this study. The complication of asymmetry was measured using CBCT measurements from T1 (prior to treatment start) and T2 (immediately following MARPE expansion). The change in U6 molar angulation changes was also assessed. Results: It was determined in the first portion of this study that the most common complication was inflammation around the MARPE site, with 82% of the study population exhibiting any severity of inflammation. 3 patients exhibited severe inflammation requiring removal of MARPE. 18% reported pain in the MARPE area. 9 patients exhibited appliance malfunction, 1 patient exhibited broken microscrew, and 1 patient exhibited pulpitis. It was determined in the second portion of this study that 47% of patients exhibited asymmetry greater than 1 mm and the average asymmetry at ANS was 1.47 mm. No correlation was exhibited between amount of asymmetric expansion and the following measures: age, molar inclination, palatal thickness, posterior screw expansion and palatal vault height. 3 Conclusions: Inflammation of the MARPE is the most common complication that can result in early removal of the expander.

Our recent report suggests that diabetes impairs MA vasorelaxation in both sexes of the UCD-T2DM model.  Particularly, we reported that MA from prediabetic male rats showed a greater impairment compared to that in prediabetic females.  However, when females become diabetic, they exhibit a greater vascular dysfunction than males.  Therefore, the aim of the first study was to investigate whether female sex hormone, specifically E2, preserves the MA vasorelaxation in female UCD-T2DM rats at the early prediabetic state.  For this study, age-matched healthy Sprague Dawley (SD) and prediabetic female UCD-T2DM rats were ovariectomized and subcutaneously implanted with either a placebo or E2 pellet for 45 days.  Regular aerobic exercise is a well-known therapeutic intervention for endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in diabetes.  However, there are still debates about the duration, intensity, and underlying mechanisms of benefits of exercise against deleterious metabolic consequences in diabetic patients.  In the second study outlined in this dissertation, we examined the impact of exercise training on vascular function and wall structure of the UCD-T2DM male rats.  Age-matched male diabetic and SD control rats were randomly divided into sedentary and exercise-trained groups.  The exercise-trained groups ran on a treadmill for eight weeks (1hr/day, 5days per week).

The results revealed an association between learning about Latinos from television and negative Latino stereotypes.  Similarly, lower willingness to communicate with Latinos was associated with negative Latino stereotypes.  However, higher willingness to communicate with Latinos was associated with positive perceptions of Latinos.  Likewise, willingness to communicate with Latinos was positively associated with self-esteem.

However, Lao Americans are not the model minority and face numerous obstacles as the community is overlooked and history is forgotten by mainstream America.  The lack of scholarly literature on Lao Americans highlights not only the general misunderstanding of the community, but also the community’s struggles in social upward mobility in addition to low higher educational attainment levels.  Therefore, the purpose of this research was to learn from the experiences of Lao American college graduates in order to support younger Lao Americans pursue their higher educational goals.  This basic qualitative study provided participants the opportunity to interpret their experiences as Lao American college graduates and make sense out of their lives.

Many Southeast Asian refugees fled their home countries after the Vietnam War to avoid political persecution. As a result of forced migration, Southeast Asian refugees experience high levels of psychological distress attributed to premigration trauma and postmigration. Stressors may include adjusting to a new culture, finding housing, establishing employment, financial hardship, learning a new language and the feeling of identity loss of their homeland. In considering these stressors, this study sought to understand how a lack of access to affordable healthy food may be impacting Southeast Asian refugees’ social, mental, and physical health. Using basic qualitative research, nine structured participant interviews were conducted. Findings suggest one way to alleviate some stress for refugees was to increase access to culturally congruent food. Additionally, increasing economic opportunities and transportation services were identified as critical to improving access to healthy food options. The theoretical framework that guided this study was resilience theory. This framework brought to light the hardship and stress experienced by refugees. I then used it to outline ways that community gardens may build individual resilience to overcome personal hardships through social support structures. The findings highlight the importance of resettling refugees in communities close to families to build individual resilience and the need for refugee resettlement practitioners to continue to offer resettlement support beyond initial arrival to the United States and until economic self-sufficiency is achieved. Additionally, four central themes emerged from individual stories of each participant’s perceptions of how food access impacts their social, mental, and physical health. The four themes were: (1) postmigration traumas create hardships among Hmong refugees, (2) poverty and physical and mental health disabilities impact food access, (3) food cultivation is deeply rooted in the Hmong culture, and (4) gardens build social communities and give hope. The study also uncovered two unexpected findings. The first was the strong cultural belief in natural healing using herbal medicine known as “tshuaj ntsuab Hmoob” or Hmong green medicine, and, secondly, the prevalent cultivation of Hmong herbal medicine plants in the gardens. For practitioners developing housing for resettled refugees, creating green space for refugees to cultivate their traditional green medicine is vital to Hmong refugees’ identity and culture.

Neotropical Adelpha butterflies contain a large number of species, and previous work indicated the colonization of a novel host plant family (Rubiaceae) fueled its rapid diversification. However, accumulating host records indicate wide taxonomic host breadth at family level and below. Here, we categorize Adelpha diet breadth based on known host plant relationships across the Neotropics and from Costa Rica, Ecuador and Brazil. We also use a diet breadth index that identifies plants used in similar ways by Adelpha, pointing to potential plant traits that could facilitate or prevent plant-insect interactions. We find that diet breadth in Adelpha is not likely to change at different geographic scales, and that regional resource specialization was uncommon. Additionally, the diversification fueled by the switch to Rubiacae, appears to have led to some lowland-clade Adelpha species specializing on a restricted subset of host genera and species within Rubiaceae, as well as in Urticaceae. In contrast, the A. serpa-group shows generalization, with each species tending to feed on its own set of several unrelated plant families. Taken together, these results indicate that Rubiaceae and additional plant families appear as important ecological factors that have promoted adaptations in Adelpha and host plant family-level switches have not always had the same effect on diversification, corroborating the importance of Rubiaceae for this butterfly genus.

Conjugating peptides to cytotoxicity agents via a linker to build peptide-drug conjugate (PDC) is a promising targeting strategy. The binding affinity of the peptide ligand and the receptor plays a crucial role in the PDC targeted drug delivery. Although the ligand binding which can be used in targeted drug delivery has been established conceptually, the quantitative or semi-quantitative contribution of binding affinity in targeting efficiency has not been fully explored. The optimal range of binding affinity of the peptide for targeted delivery remains unknown. Therefore, there is a lack of knowledge on the relationship between the peptide binding affinity and targeted drug delivery efficiency. The major steps in peptide drug delivery include cellular binding, cellular internalization, and tumor cells killing. In this study, three EGFR-targeting peptides with binding affinity levels ranging from 22 nM to 1.25 μM were selected to study their targeted drug delivery efficiency. The cellular binding study of FITC labeled peptides showed that peptide GE11 with the highest binding affinity had the highest cellular binding among three peptides. PEP11 peptide showed enhanced cellular binding compared to the L1 peptide. Moreover, GE11 also showed the selectivity of cellular binding between EGFR-positive cells and EGFR-negative cells. The cellular distribution showed that GE11-FITC could be successfully internalized into cells. The uptake mechanism studies demonstrated that the cellular uptake of GE11-FITC was based on receptor-mediated endocytosis, meaning that the cellular binding of GE11 was able to trigger the endocytosis. MMAE, a non-selective anticancer agent, was conjugated to the peptides through a protease-sensitive linker. The cytotoxicity assay showed that GE11-MMAE had the highest drug delivery efficiency and selectivity of three peptides, with 200 folds lower IC50 value than MMAE in EGFR-positive cells and 1000 times lower in EGFR-negative cells. PEP11-MMAE also showed an enhanced drug delivery than MMAE and L1-MMAE. L1-MMAE failed to show a significant difference with MMAE.

All eight respondents experienced an overall increased capacity to navigate difficult thoughts, emotions and physical experiences, oftentimes extending into more adaptive external behaviors. Six of the eight respondents reported that their meditation practice contributed to improved focus and attentional abilities. According to all the respondents, meditation practice contributed to their development of mindfulness, and this mindfulness development was incorporated in their daily lives – a particularly promising finding.

With the reports of various AHR targets genes, the expression levels and activities of AHR have been implicated in many physiological and pathological situations. Understanding how AHR protein level is regulated would provide more information to target AHR. AHR stays in the cytosol in the absence of ligand in a complex with HSP90, p23 and XAP2. After ligand activation, AHR translocates into the nucleus, fulfilling its transactivation function and then is finally degraded by proteasomes. Here, we discovered a new mechanism that controls basal AHR protein level: the selective autophagy. Loss of AHR co-chaperone p23 leads to increased protein degradation of AHR through autophagy in HeLa cells. Inhibition of autophagy using several inhibitors (chloroquine, bafilomycin A1 or 3-methyladenine) increased AHR protein levels. Knocking down of key macroautophagy protein LC3B increases AHR protein levels and decreases the responsiveness of AHR to CQ treatment. The interaction between AHR and LC3B as well as AHR and autophagy receptor p62 were confirmed in vitro and in situ. AHR is found to be lysine (K) 63-ubiquitinated in HeLa cells, which is a common signal for the autophagy-lysosomal degradation.6 We also discovered that AHR is controlled by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) phosphorylation. Inhibition of GSK3β activity or its expression level increased AHR protein levels while expression of HA tagged-GSK3β lowers AHR protein levels. AHR protein level is regulated through autophagy. We confirmed the GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of AHR by phos-tag gel electrophoresis couples with Western blot analysis and identified three putative phosphorylation sites of AHR in the C-terminal half of AHR sequence. Moreover, phosphorylated AHR constitutes the active pool for transactivation and phosphorylation tagged AHR for the autophagy-lysosomal degradation, which may act as way to limit its function.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4760&context=uop_etds,2021,-17.241146,-13.091898,POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATION AND DEGRADATION MECHANISMS OF THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR,"Yang, Y."

The Invisalign First clear aligner appliance as a modality for early interceptive orthodontic treatment has become incorporated into orthodontic practices in very recent years. The present study aims to investigate the magnitude of expansion of the Invisalign First clear aligner appliance compared to a Schwartz removable expander in patients with mixed dentition.  Additionally, the study aims to compare the efficacy and predictability of Invisalign First clear aligners in this population. Materials & Methods: In this retrospective study, a sample was collected from a single orthodontist practitioner. The sample consisted of 34 patients, 16 patients treated with Invisalign First clear aligners only (Group1) and 19 patients treated with a Schwartz removable appliance and Invisalign First clear aligners (Group 2). Intraoral scans of four timepoints, initial (T1), post-expansion for Group 2 only (T1Exp), first refinement (T2), and final (T3), and planned Clincheck goal (P) model from Clincheck software were imported to Align Technology’s digital measure program (Quantify©). Arch widths and molar inclinations were measured at each timepoint and the changes between timepoints were calculated. Predictability of arch expansion was calculated as T13 (change between initial and final) divided by the Planned dimension multiplied by one hundred. A two sample t-test was used to assess differences in the changes in arch widths and predictability of expansion between two groups. Results: There were statistically significant differences found in the magnitude of expansion and predictability of arch expansion between two groups. Group 2 showed a greater amount of expansion and predictability. Group 1 showed about 50-60% of the planned expansion at the end of treatment. In regards to magnitude of expansion when comparing the two groups, the efficacy predictability of transverse dimensional changes were significantly greater in the Group 2 compared to Group 1,  83% vs 56% (p = 0.001), respectively. The changes in inclination were similar in both groups, with no statistically significant differences.Conclusions: There is a significantly greater amount of expansion and greater predictability with the Schwartz removable appliance compared to the Invisalign First clear aligner appliance in the mixed dentition. The predictability of Invisalign First was 56% and indicates a significant overcorrection of arch expansion is required at the virtual treatment planning stage in Clincheck in order to obtain the arch expansion that was planned",Dentistry,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=dugoni_etd,2021,4.770902,-9.640242,Comparison of Maxillary Expansion Between Clear Aligners and Removable Expansion Appliance in the Mixed Dentition,"Zaverdinos, M."

The homing process is the dynamic way in which people create home according to their life circumstances: food, eating, and culinary customs after migration in this case. Home is not only the place where people live, but also, where they come from and how they feel comfortable; home is both a physical space and an abstract concept. Home, and the various definitions of home, are mapped out in this project because understanding these various meanings allows for a clear understanding of the homing process for migrants. To explore Syrian migrants’ foodways in California, I conducted interviews with these six families, and, in analyzing the interviews, chose four salient culinary customs to demonstrate the role of foodways in the homing process. The four culinary customs are: the distinct morning coffee ritual; mealtimes and meal routines imposed by work or school; lunch as the day’s main meal, which must be tabekh (cooked food); and the importance of handmade food. Taken together, the consistent patterns followed, and energy devoted towards food and culinary customs provide evidence that effort expended in maintaining customary foodways is effort in recreating home. This project adds to existing scholarship on the relationship between foodways and migrant communities’ identity maintenance in that it demonstrates a unique and particular devotion to the rhythm and ritual of foodways that allows Syrians to not only make a new home, but to also feel at home in a new land.",Other,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4675&context=uop_etds,2020,4.656859,13.764257,THE ROLE OF FOOD AND CULINARY CUSTOMS IN THE HOMING PROCESS FOR SYRIAN MIGRANTS IN CALIFORNIA,"Baho, S."

Some quantitative and qualitative studies have shown positive results of corequisite courses in English, and some math courses such as statistics, but there is limited quantitative research on the effects of the corequisite model on student academic performance in STEM math courses, like college algebra and precalculus.  Many mathematics department faculty members believe that the corequisite model, especially in STEM math courses, may not work in community colleges due to the population consisting of a large number of non-traditional and under-prepared students at these institutions.  This causal comparative study attempted to compare the academic performance of students from corequisite and prerequisite (traditional) types of precalculus courses after controlling for their gender, generational status, prior academic achievement (high school grade point average, HSGPA), and ethnicity.  The study also investigated whether the effect of course type on precalculus course grades is moderated by students’ generational status, prior academic achievement, and ethnicity.  The moderating effects of variables were studied after controlling for the other background variables.  Samples for this study were taken from two California community colleges that taught precalculus courses with both models (corequisite and prerequisite) prior to Fall 2019.  The data for each of the colleges were analyzed separately because of their different academic systems (semester versus quarter).  Sequential multiple regression was used and variations were found in the results from the two colleges.  In addition to tests of statistical significance, effect sizes (based on Cohen’s d) were calculated to measure the magnitude of the difference between groups.  Statistically significant findings from College A (a pseudonym) suggest that the corequisite model of courses in precalculus impacts overall student grades in a positive way.  In contrast, there was insufficient evidence based upon data from College B to conclude that corequisite precalculus courses impact course grades.  Furthermore, moderating effects were found.  In College A, some subgroups (such as Filipinx, Latinx, and White students, those with higher prior academic achievement, or who were first-generation college students) were found to perform better in corequisite courses than prerequisite courses, while students with lower prior achievement (based on HSGPA) performed better with the prerequisite type of courses.  The results from both Colleges A and B were consistent in finding that students with lower HSGPA performed worse on average in corequisite precalculus courses.  Ethnicity was found to moderate the effect of course type on precalculus course grades when the data from College B was analyzed.  The results showed a medium-large effect (d= -0.65) for Latinx students who, on average, performed worse in the corequisite precalculus course as compared to the prerequisite version.  However, students at College A, regardless of ethnicity, performed better on average in the corequisite classes, and the effect sizes ranged from small to medium-large across the ethnic groups.

In order to assess changes in current stigma levels, valid measurement tools are needed to make more accurate assessments. Many existing tools used to assess stigma levels present validity issues due to reporting bias, specifically social desirability bias. Researchers suggest that purposefully omitting diagnostic labeling helps to eliminate biased answers. In order to measure stigmatizing beliefs while minimizing the threat of social desirability, this study utilized an experimental design that compared mental health conditions with medical conditions. The Adjusted Attribution Questionnaire and Social Distance Scale were used to measure stigmatized beliefs toward each health conditions. Levels of familiarity and demographic characteristics were controlled for in analysis to determine potential mediating and moderating effects. Results indicate that familiarity had a significant effect on perceived attribution and preferred social distance for the mental health group.

However, research suggests college students who count drinks and set drink limits are less likely to engage in binge drinking.  In order to successfully use these tactics, college students must identify and pour standard servings of alcohol.  Unfortunately, college students typically cannot identify or pour standard servings of alcohol.  Behavioral Skills Training (BST), comprised of instruction, modeling, rehearsal, and feedback (Miltenberger, 2008), can be used to teach college students to pour standard servings of alcohol (Hankla et al., 2017).  If effective, universities might consider incorporating BST into their mandated alcohol education courses.  However, because of the time investment required for properly using BST to teach this skill, it is important to examine whether participants demonstrate maintenance of skills over time and generalization across untrained cups.  In the current study we used a non-concurrent multiple baseline across participants research design that included generality assessments with two untrained stimuli (cups), different in shape, color, and volume.  All three participants poured inaccurately during baseline.  Following BST with the first trained cup, all three poured accurately into the trained cup, reproducing results from previous studies (Hankla et al., 2018; Schultz et al., 2019).  During follow up, two participants poured accurately in all three cups, and one participant poured accurately in one cup.  This suggests, pending further data collection, that the skill of pouring standard servings of beer might maintain over time and generalize across untrained cups.",Educational and School Psychology,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4685&context=uop_etds,2020,5.310026,-1.3452506,Evaluation of Behavioral Skills Training (BST) to Teach College Students to Pour a Standard Serving of Alcohol Skill Acquisition and Generality Across Cups and Time,"Brock, M."

Crime drama offers a unique perspective because victims and offenders change every episode increasing stereotypes with each new character. In other words, the more victims and criminals observed by the audience, the more likely the show creates the perception of a mean world. Based on previous literature, three questions emerged which this study focused on by asking the extent of Criminal Minds’ ability to portray crime accurately compared to the Federal Bureau of Investigations Uniform Crime Report (UCR) and the Behavioral Analysis Unit’s (BAU-4) report on serial murderers and how those portrayals changed over the fifteen years of the show. A content analysis was conducted through the lens of cultivation theory, coding 324 episodes which produced a sample size of 354 different cases to answer the research questions. Two additional coders focused on the first, middle, and last episodes of each season (N=45) for reliability. The key findings are low levels of realism with the UCR and high levels of realism with the BAU-4 statistics. Mean-world syndrome was found to be highly likely to be cultivated in heavy viewers. Finally, roles for minority groups did improve overtime for Black and Brown bodies, yet Asian bodies saw a very small increase in representation. LGBT members were nearly nonexistent.

Expression levels of this receptor protein are sensitive to the cellular p23 protein levels in immortalized cancer cell lines. As little as 30% reduction of the p23 cellular content can suppress the AHR function. Here we reported that down-regulation of the p23 protein content in normal, untransformed human bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells to 48% of its content also suppresses the AHR protein levels to 54% of its content. This p23-mediated suppression of AHR is responsible for the repression of (1) the ligand-dependent induction of the cyp1a1 gene transcription; (2) the benzo[a]pyrene- or cigarette smoke condensate-induced CYP1A1 enzyme activity, and (3) the benzo[a]pyrene and cigarette smoke condensate-mediated production of reactive oxygen species. Reduction of the p23 content does not alter expression of oxidative stress genes or production of PGE2. Down-regulation of p23 suppresses the AHR protein levels in two other untransformed cell types, namely human breast MCF-10A and mouse immune regulatory Tr1 cells.

Self-care is essential for the counseling profession in California community colleges (CCC), as it promotes wellness, which is needed in order to provide optimal services to students/clients. The lack of self-care results in counselor impairment, leading to undesirable factors (i.e., burnout, health conditions, and decrease in productivity). In educational institutions, counselors often find it difficult to maintain their own self-care. However, work environments have been shown to affect self-care at work (professional self-care). Past studies have suggested that the work environment can help counselors increase their ability to practice self-care. In this quantitative statewide study on 324 CCC counselors, it was found that the work environment was related to and predicted CCC counselors' professional self-care, even when considering demographic variables. Additional findings from this research study indicated that CCC counselors’ workload had the highest relation with counselors’ daily balance. Differences in groups (e.g., demographic/contextual factors) are found among CCC counselors' work environment and professional self-care, with the greatest group difference on CCC counselors’ status (e.g., tenured, adjunct). Results also suggest that CCC counselors who worked overload (if full-time) strengthened the relationship between their professional development and a sense of community in the workplace. However, overload hours worked per week showed a negative association with their sense of community. These results may be useful to community college counselors and administrators for organizational planning, policy, and advocacy of self-care-promoting work environments for CCC counselors.

Arthur Dugoni School of Dentistry   2020    Introduction. Genetic etiology of nonsyndromic orofacial clefts comprises many genes acting together. However, little is known about their interactions. The purpose of our study was to analyze associations of phenotypic subtypes of nonsyndromic orofacial clefts with combinations of four genotypes involving candidate gene polymorphisms.   Materials and Methods. We analyzed a large dataset of cases and controls collected in one location (Karaikal in India) and genotyped for four gene polymorphisms: RFC1 G80A, MTHFR C677T, IRF6 GA rs642961 and IRF6 CT rs2235371 (IRB approval Nr. 17-118 for existing data). The samples were tested for Hardy-Weinberg genetic equilibrium. Combinations of genotypes in cleft subsamples were compared with controls using Odds Ratio and Confidence Interval (95% significance level) calculations.   Results. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test showed that all samples were in genetic equilibrium. Some combinations of RFC1 G80A, MTHFR C677T, IRF6 GA rs642961 and IRF6 CT rs2235371 yielded increased or decreased Odds Ratio (OR>1 or OR<1).This means that subtypes of orofacial clefts were differentially determined by genotype combinations of four gene polymorphisms.   Conclusions. Our results suggest that combinations of gene polymorphisms may modulate genetic risk in subtypes of nonsyndromic orofacial clefts.

In order to assess personality characteristics, The Myers-Briggs Type Inventory (MBTI) was used. For teaching method categorization Grasha’s (2002) classification was used. This research builds knowledge about personality traits as measured by the Myers-Briggs Type Inventory® of dental students in Kuwait. Further, it adds knowledge about teaching methods preferred by dental students. Two surveys, the Myers- Briggs Type Indicator® Form M and a brief learning preference for teaching methodology survey, served as data collection instruments. Twenty-seven out of 43 dental students were interested in participation. Twenty-three (53.4%) students completed both surveys. After the data were analyzed, no dominant personality types among the dental students surveyed was uncovered. There were, however, four types slightly more represented than others. This study did find some correlations between certain subgroups and preferences for teaching methods. The study also found that students perceived Hybrid and Demonstrator methods as both the most preferred and most beneficial.

In addition, this study identified factors that may affect pharmacy students’ likelihood of reporting peers’ academic dishonesty including the relationship between the cheater and their observer, the severity of the punishment on the reported cheating, and the reporting systems. Fifty-six out of 271 respondents (20.7%) reported their engagement of academic dishonesty. One hundred forty-four respondents (53.1%) reported that they directly observed someone else’s cheating behavior. One hundred eighty-nine respondents (69.7%) reported that they indirectly heard about someone else’s cheating behavior from others who directly observed cheating; yet, only 25 respondents (9.2%) peer-reported their classmates’ cheating.The current study shows that although the majority of participants believe that peer-reporting is ethical, they have not reported the cheating they observed due in part to fear of retaliation and no information (or clear direction) on who they should report to or how to report. Additionally, the current study shows that if an innovative system to anonymously report cheating (e.g., a specific peer-reporting website or hotline to protect confidentiality) is adopted, the likelihood to report in the innovative system is higher than in the current system across all types of student-student relationships and all levels of punishment. The current study also demonstrated a statistically significant inverse relationship between likelihood to report and punishment severity. Peer-reporting can be an effective method when well-established polices protect peer-reporters from retaliation and when transparent and reasonable punishments are assigned to those who engage in academic dishonesty.

Their contractions do not account, however, for the behavioral control of call complexity observed in male túngara frogs (Engystomops pustulosus), which optionally add a secondary note with distinct harmonic structure to their advertisement call.  Examination of the túngara frog's laryngeal morphology through dissection, microtomography, and resin histology has revealed that the m. dilatator laryngis is divided into two separate bundles (superficial and deep).  The superficial bundle closely matches the typical description of the m. dilatator laryngis and is well positioned to open the glottis.  The deep bundle is exclusively innervated by the short laryngeal nerve and has an attachment to the fibrous mass, an internal laryngeal structure necessary for complex call production.  This attachment indicates a separate role for the deep bundle in controlling the complexity of the call.  Based on physical separation, exclusive attachments, distinct fiber orientation, exclusive innervation, and potential action, this study recognizes the deep bundle of the m. dilatator laryngis as a separate muscle.  It also revalidates the name m. arylabialis which had been previously used to describe it.  The split of the m. dilatator laryngis into two muscles results in a laryngeal innervation pattern that closely matches that of mammals.

Methods: Standardized training blocks with j-shaped canals were used (n=64); half of the simulated canals were shaped to apical size #35(.06 taper) and the remaining 32 to #45(.06). The frequency and extent of Ca(OH)2 extrusion were measured relative to apical taper, the depth of insertion, and whether syringe or spiral filler was used.

Current understanding of the disease is derived mainly from case reports and small case series, prompting further elucidation of its epidemiology and prognostic factors that affect outcome. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to examine demographic characteristics, clinicopathologic features, and prognostic factors in patients with oropharyngeal LEC. Methods: The U.S. National Cancer Institute’s SEER registry was queried to obtain data on patients with primary oropharyngeal LEC from 1975 to 2016. Variables examined include age at diagnosis, sex, race, year of diagnosis, primary site of tumor origin, tumor size, extent, nodal status, overall stage, tumor grade, surgical treatment, and county socioeconomic status (SES). Kaplan-Meier univariable and Cox regression model multivariable analyses were conducted to identify independent predictors of survival. Results: In total, 199 cases of primary LEC in the oropharynx were found. Overall survival rates at 2-, 5-, and 10-years were 81.0%, 74.0%, and 56.0%, respectively. Disease-specific survival rates at 2-, 5-, and 10-years were 85.0%, 80.0%, and 77.0%, respectively. Multivariable analysis identified older age at diagnosis, Black race, and tonsil primary site to be independent predictors of worse survival. Contrarily, a more recent year of diagnosis, surgical resection, and higher county SES were identified to be associated with an improved prognosis. Conclusion: Oropharyngeal LEC is a rare malignancy that is diagnosed mostly in White males in the fifth decade of life.

Lujan,"Education, Special education, Elementary education, Administrator support for Special Education, FAPE, IDEA, Students with Disabilities, Support for Special Education Teacher, Transformational Leadership","Since the inception of special education laws in the 1970’s, special education teachers have been given the responsibility of educating children with exceptional needs.  Those needs range from children with mild to moderate disabilities to children with moderate to severe disabilities.  There are 13 categories that a child can qualify for special education services through an Individual Education Program (IEP).  The majority of children with exceptional needs are educated on general education campuses.  With high stakes testing and the push for academic excellence, one may wonder how a child with exceptional needs fits into a general education campus.  The Education of Handicapped Act (EHA) was passed in 1970 and guaranteed that every child was entitled to a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) at any public-school facility.  Since that time, more laws have been updated and renamed giving a child with a disability more access and rights to a FAPE.  Special education can be very complex, and teachers must work with students who have a varying degree of disabilities.  Special education teachers are responsible for creating lessons to address the academic and behavioral needs of each of their students on their caseloads.  They must also collaborate with the general education teachers to make sure they are aware of the needs and goals of the students in their classes.  They are responsible for writing the IEP for each student on their caseload.  They must evaluate their students throughout the school year on their goals and update their progress.  Another role that the special education teacher has is to train the instructional assistance to work with the students and their unique needs (Capper & Frattura, 2009; Prather-Jones, 2011). Research shows that the main reasons special education teachers gave for leaving was lack of administrative support, huge caseloads, the demands of the IEP (Individual Education Program) paperwork, followed by isolation, too much diversity of student needs and the lack of appreciation by co-workers and administrators for all their hard work (Billingsley & Cross, 1991, 2007; Crocket, 2007; Prather-Jones, 2011).",Education,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4668&context=uop_etds,2020,12.914411,4.5935345,The importance of administrative support for special education teachers,"Lujan, S."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of rotary file instrumentation (TruNatomy and XP-Endo Shaper) on peri-cervical dentin removal, depending on access size.   Materials and Methods Forty 3D printed mandibular first molars, with either a small or large access design, were instrumented using TruNatomy or XP-endo Shaper file systems. Canal volumes were calculated based on micro-computed tomography data obtained pre- and post-operatively. Digital sectioning of each reconstructed volume was performed 90-degrees to the long axis at the floor of the pulp chamber at 5 levels, at the pulp chamber floor (Level 0) as well as 1 and 2mm coronally and apically of Level 0. Linear measurements were taken from the inner wall of the access cavity or canal to the outer surface of the tooth for both instrumentation techniques and compared to the unprepared control dataset. These measurements served as an approximation of remaining peri-cervical dentin after root canal instrumentation.   Results   Some of the coronal measurements were not reportable for the control group due to incomplete capture of the crown during the microCT scan. The remaining peri-cervical dentin thickness at the level of the pulpal floor and coronally were significantly (p<0.01) affected by the access cavity size, with the smaller access preserving more dentin in all samples. Apical to the pulpal floor, there was no significant difference between instrumentation groups at the data points evaluated. Remaining dentin thickness was largest at coronal section 1 and smallest at apical section 6 with 3.81mm (p = 0.05) and 1.84mm (p = 0.06), respectively.   Conclusion Access cavity size had a significant impact on remaining dentin thickness at the level of the pulpal floor and coronally, with more remaining dentin in the conservative access group, irrespective of instrumentation technique.

We evaluated an intervention package comprised of this moral story, instruction, and rule in combination with praising honest reports when reinforcement favored lying.  We identified and used each participant’s preferred topography of praise using a multiple-stimulus without replacement preference assessment (MSWO; Deleon & Iwata, 1996).

In this thesis, I employ procedural rhetoric and feminist scholarship to analyze the rhetorical power of God of War. I focus on the game’s immersive procedures and the performances of masculinity from Kratos, Atreus, and Baldur. These three characters all perform different masculinities, and their interactions with one another inform the game’s portrayal of masculinity and fatherhood. By engaging in violence and depicting nuanced performances of masculinity, God of War positions the player to recognize harmful hegemonic masculine norms and their effects on men and their relationships.

Padda,"Behavior, Gryllus, Multiple stressors, Phenoloxidase, Wing dimorphism, Animal sciences, Ecology, Animal sciences","The frequency, duration, and co-occurrence of several environmental stressors are increasing globally.  Multiple stressors may have compounding or interactive effects on animals, resulting in either additive or non-additive costs, but animals may mitigate these costs through various strategies of resource conservation or shifts in resource allocation.  Thus, through two related factorial experiments, I measured a range of traits—from those related to life history and behavior to underlying physiology— to investigate the nature of costs (additive, non-additive, or neither additive nor non-additive), cost-mitigating strategies (resource conservation or allocation), and life-history strategy related to multiple stressors.  First, I leveraged life-history strategy differences in the sand field cricket, Gryllus firmus, to investigate the individual and interactive effects of food and water limitation on fitness-related traits. Gryllus crickets exhibit a wing dimorphism mediating two distinct life-history strategies—long-winged crickets invest into flight capability while short-winged crickets do not.  My results indicate that traits vary in their sensitivity to environmental stressors and stressor-stressor interactions (e.g., flight muscle).  I only found support for non-additive costs or single-stressor costs of water and food limitation to fitness-related traits.  Water availability had a larger effect on traits than food availability, affected more traits than food availability (wing dimorphism), and mediated the effects of food availability.  Second, I investigated the role of life-history strategy in cost-mitigating strategies and further examined the costs (additive or non-additive) of multiple stressors to fitness-related traits, physiology, and behavior.  I used the variable field cricket, Gryllus lineaticeps, to examine the costs of a simulated heat wave and water limitation.  These stressors resulted primarily in single-stressor or non-additive costs to important traits (e.g., survival, final body mass, and total water content), extensive shifts in resource allocation priorities (e.g., reduced prioritization of body mass), and a limited capacity to conserve resources (heat wave reduced energy use only when water was available).  Further, life-history strategy influenced the emergency life history stage (ELHS) because wing morphology and stressor(s) interacted to influence gonad and body mass, boldness behavior, and immunocompetence.  Together, these two studies demonstrate that water availability and life-history strategy should be incorporated into future studies integrating important conceptual frameworks of stress (multiple-stressor framework and ELHS) across a suite of traits—from survival and life history to behavior and physiology.",Biological Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4695&context=uop_etds,2020,-16.057018,7.084724,Stressed Out Life-History Strategy and the Costs of Multiple Stressors in Gryllus Crickets,"Padda, S."

The procedure, which consists of full flap corticotomies and bone grafting, has many proposed benefits including increased speed and range of tooth movement. The purpose of this study is to evaluate arch expansion in patients treated with SFOT and clear aligners. Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort study design was used to evaluate 51 consecutive adult patients that were treatment planned for significant arch expansion with corticotomies, bone grafting, and clear aligners. 17 of the 51 patients refused the surgical procedure and served as controls. Eight transverse arch width measurements were obtained at three different time points (Initial, ClinCheck, Refinement). Five calculations were performed to determine the magnitude, predictability, and efficiency of arch expansion. Results: The difference in treatment time between the two groups was statistically significant at 5.2 months (P < .0001). On average, corticotomies reduced the length of treatment by 46% and increased the rate of expansion 2.4x. Patients that received SFOT achieved a greater magnitude (+28%) of expansion at a significantly higher rate (P< 0.002) than controls for all eight interarch measurements. The SFOT group displayed higher predictability (% goal achieved) and a smaller difference between predicted and achieved tooth movements for all measures obtained. The mean age for the entire sample was 42.81 (+12.51 years).

However, a better examination of the mechanisms producing changes may help identify effective interventions. PURPOSE: To test the effect of a vigorous exercise prescription on drug abstinence in voluntary rehabilitation patients. METHODS: 25 surveyed participants in a male drug treatment program underwent a 12-week minimum training program. The program included moderate-rigorous exercise and psychotherapy. Three days per week all subjects participated in EP for 90 minutes. Subjects also participated in ABIT 3 days per week where each session lasted 2 hours. Subjects also participated in ESM which ran for 90 minutes 5 days per week. Within each week, program participants also completed between 2-3 hours of psychotherapy (individual and/or group) per day, varying depending on level of care and phase of the treatment process. Exercise performance and adherence, sobriety and relapse rates, and emotional coping skills were collected. RESULTS: Subjects experienced frequent relapse (5±8 occurrences) prior to admission; however, 84% were currently sober on completion of the program, 8% relapsed during treatment, and 36% relapsed after treatment. The longest duration of sobriety a subject achieved was 273±111 days. Post-treatment survey results indicate 84% of subjects still exercised regularly, 68% continued to practice yoga or meditation, and 60% followed a diet that required disciplined awareness. Bench press max improved significantly throughout the program (39%; p<.001), as did squat (55% improvement; p<0.001) and deadlift (69.8%; p<0.001). On completion of the survey 91% of patients who exercised regularly were sober; 50% of patients who did not engage in regular exercise were sober on completion of the program (P=0.043). Owing to a small sample of patients who relapsed during treatment (N=2), the difference in exercisers who relapsed during treatment (5%) and non-exercisers who relapsed (25%) was not significant (P=0.171). Twenty-nine percent of exercisers relapsed after treatment; 75% of non-exercisers relapsed after treatment (P=0.076). The odds of managing adverse emotional states when they arose increased 20-fold among subjects who reported regular participation in exercise (Nagelkerke R2=0.333; P=0.036). Similarly, each additional day per week that a patient practiced yoga predicted a 20-day increase in duration of sobriety (R2=0.227; P=0.016). CONCLUSION: Exercise training exerts a statistically significant positive effect for sobriety and coping skills within a population that previously struggled with perpetual relapse.",Health and Sport Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4681&context=uop_etds,2020,3.4274309,-9.697824,EXERCISE TRAINING AS ADJUNCT THERAPY FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER,"Roessel, E."

Traditionally, covalent DNA binders like alkylating agents have been used to induce genetic instability through the formation of DNA lesions and strand breaks, leading to cellular apoptosis. The primary drawback of this treatment is the non-specific binding that affects both cancerous and non-cancerous cells. G-quadruplexes are the DNA secondary structures that are present in abundance near the promoter regions of the oncogenes and are involved in the regulation of their activities. A ligand-mediated stabilization of G-quadruplexes in the promoter regions and down-regulation of the associated oncogenes have been validated. In contrast to alkylating agents, G-quadruplex ligands induce genetic stabilization through non-covalent interactions. They can be designed to interact specifically with G-quadruplex DNA over duplex DNA, which reduce side effects arising from the off-targeting. G-quadruplex ligands invariably have the large planar aromatic moiety to interact with G-quadruplexes through π- π stacking interactions. For determining the size effect of the aromatic moiety on stabilization of G-quadruplexes, a series of ligands were synthesized by conjugating nucleobases or 1,10-phenanthroline with an aminoglycoside, neomycin. The resulting conjugates increased the binding affinity synergistically and enabled us to study the effect of the stacking moiety required for G-quadruplex stabilization. Nucleobase-neomycin conjugates did not show stabilization stabilize of human telomeric G-quadruplex. 1,10-Phenanthroline-neomycin conjugate (7b) on the other hand binds to human telomeric G-quadruplex with a Ka of (8.92.4)×108 M-1 and inhibits telomerase activity at 1.56 µM probably through G-quadruplex stabilization. Moving forward, we further enlarged the aromatic moiety by tethering two 1,10-phenantholine molecules together through a five-atom linker. The resulting molecule (2-Clip-phen) was conjugated with various amino-containing side chains. 2-Clip-phen derivatives showed at least 30 times weaker binding to duplex DNA over G-quadruplex DNA. In addition, compounds showed a preference for the antiparallel G-quadruplex conformation over parallel and hybrid G-quadruplex conformations, as shown in the CD spectroscopy studies. Ligands 11 and 13 induced the formation of an antiparallel G-quadruplex from random coils and stabilize it to 60 oC (Tm) in a salt-free condition. Mass spectrometry study showed the formation of a two-tetrad G-quadruplex with the 2-Clip-phen ligand. Docking study showed that the ligand interacts most favorably with antiparallel G-quadruplex conformation, which is supported further by the larger thermal stabilization effect on antiparallel G-quadruplex compared with other G-quadruplex conformations. Our study suggests that 2-Clip-phen can be used as a scaffold for designing G-quadruplex binding ligands that preferentially bind to antiparallel G-quadruplexes, which has never been reported before.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4724&context=uop_etds,2020,-24.460093,-13.37359,STUDIES ON THE SIZE AND NON-PLANARITY OF AROMATIC STACKING MOIETY ON CONFORMATION SELECTIVITY AND THERMAL STABILIZATION OF G-QUADRUPLEXES,"Singh, M."

As a result of communication being ubiquitous in nature, it becomes inevitable that at some point conflict will occur as competing ideas, world views, or beliefs are exchanged. This inevitability, therefore, necessitates researchers make attempts to better understand the role conflict tendencies can play in influencing communication variables that are generally understood to be pro-social. The researcher administered a questionnaire to 226 college students from one private university and three community colleges on the west coast using various modified scales examining tolerance for disagreement, verbal aggressiveness, self-esteem, communication competence, and evaluation apprehension. The data from the surveys were analyzed to determine whether the independent variables could in isolation or in combination serve as predictors for self-esteem, communication competence, and evaluation apprehension. The analysis revealed that tolerance for disagreement was significantly positively correlated with self-esteem and communication competence and was significantly negatively correlated with evaluation apprehension. Verbal aggressiveness was found to be significantly negatively correlated with communication competence and the construct of “Pro-Social Communication Outcomes” which combined all three dependent variables.  The construct this work refers to as “Conflict Tendencies” which combines both independent variables was found to be significantly negatively correlated with communication competence and Pro-Social Communication Outcomes. Regression analysis showed that the combination of tolerance for disagreement and verbal aggressiveness demonstrated that tolerance for disagreement and verbal aggressiveness had some limited predicting power regarding self-esteem, communication competence, and evaluation apprehension.

Experiments involving 1,3-dioxolane were carried out in the photon energy range of 9.5‒13.5 eV.  The statistical thermodynamics model shows that a total of six dissociation channels are involved in the formation of three fragment ions, namely C3H5O2+ (m/z 73), C2H5O+ (m/z 45) and C2H4O+ (m/z 44), with two channels contributing to the formation of each.  By comparing the results of ab initio quantum chemical calculations to the experimentally derived appearance energies of the fragment ions, the most likely mechanisms for these unimolecular dissociation reactions are proposed, including a description of the relevant parts of the potential energy surface.In the case of methyl vinyl ketone, an important atmospheric intermediate in the oxidation of isoprene, between 9.5‒13.8 eV four main fragment ions were detected at m/z 55, 43, 42, and 27 aside from the parent ion at m/z 70.  The m/z 55 fragment ion (C2H3CO+) is formed from ionized MVK by direct methyl loss, while breaking the C–C bond on the other side of the carbonyl group results in the acetyl cation (CH3CO+, m/z 43) and the vinyl radical.  The m/z 42 fragment ion is formed via a CO loss from the molecular ion after a methyl shift.  The lightest fragment ion, the vinyl cation (C2H3+ at m/z 27), is produced in two different reactions: acetyl radical loss from the molecular ion and CO-loss from C2H3CO+.  Their contributions to the m/z 27 signal are quantified based on the acetyl and vinyl fragment thermochemical anchors and quantum-chemical calculations.  Based on the experimentally derived appearance energy of the m/z 43 fragment ion, a new, experimentally derived heat of formation is proposed for gaseous methyl vinyl ketone (ΔfH0K = −94.2 ± 4.8 kJ mol−1; ΔfH298K = −110.4 ± 4.8 kJ mol−1), together with cationic heats of formation and bond dissociation energies.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4725&context=uop_etds,2020,-9.399483,0.42980844,ELEPHANT AND ANCHORS ‒ PHOTOELECTRON PHOTOION COINCIDENCE SPECTROSCOPY OF SMALL OXYGENATED MOLECULES,"Weidner, a."

When jet fuels fail ASTM D3241, either at the refinery or in the distribution system, there can be supply disruptions and financial losses. Understanding the causes of poor thermal oxidative stability in jet fuels could help prevent or mitigate issues. In order to develop a deeper understanding of the molecular precursors that lead to ASTM D3241 failures, a number of analytical methodologies and data treatment techniques have been developed, applied, and reported here. Statistical analysis of LC/MS ESI data from jet fuels with varying thermal oxidative stabilities allows for the identification of molecules that are significant to ASTM D3241 failures. Differential statistical analysis of LC/MS ESI data from jet fuels before and after thermal oxidative stressing in a QCM reactor elucidates which significant molecules are being consumed during oxidation and which molecules are increasing in abundance. The analysis of thermal oxidative deposits that form during thermal oxidative stressing in the QCM reactor allows for the insight into the molecular components of the deposits. Attapulgus clay removes the polar molecules that lead to thermal oxidative stability issues in the refinery. Extraction of Attapulgus clay that has been used in a refinery to filter jet fuel with a series of solvents removes the polar molecules into a series of fractions.

In the photon energy range of 11.4–14.0 eV, energy selected CH3OOH+ ions dissociate into CH2OOH+, HCO+, CH3+, and H3O+ ions. The lowest-energy dissociation channel is the formation of the cation of the smallest “QOOH” radical, CH2OOH+. A statistical rate model fitted to the experimental data yields a 0 K appearance energy of 11.647 ± 0.005 eV for the CH2OOH+ ion, and a 74.2 ± 2.6 kJ mol–1 mixed experimental-theoretical 0 K heat of formation for the CH2OOH radical. The proton affinity of the Criegee intermediate, CH2OO, was also obtained from the heat of formation of CH2OOH+ (792.8 ± 0.9 kJ mol–1) to be 847.7 ± 1.1 kJ mol–1, reducing the uncertainty of the previously available computational value by a factor of 4. RRKM modeling of the higher-energy fragmentation processes, supported by Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations, found that the HCO+ fragment ion is produced through a roaming transition state; H3O+ is formed in a consecutive process from the CH2OOH+ fragment ion; and direct C–O fission of the molecular ion leads to the methyl cation. Experimentally, 2-propanol has been found to dissociate primarily into CH2CHOH+, CH3CHOH+, CH3CHCH3+, and, as a minor product, into (CH3)2COH+ ions within a photon energy range of 10.0–13.1eV. There are interesting dissociation dynamics involving breaking the C–¬C bond: the lowest energy product (CH3 loss) is quickly outcompeted by a kinetically favored CH4 loss. At low internal energies of < 0.3 eV, the loss of CH4 dominates through a roaming pathway, when the leaving CH3 abstracts a hydrogen atom from the other methyl group. At higher energy, the direct loss of CH3• quickly takes over as its transition state is much less tight and, thus, it is kinetically favored. The statistical model fitted to the experimental data yielded the appearance energy corresponding to the thermochemical limit for the CH3-loss dissociation and the 0 K heats of formation of the CH3CHOH+ ion was found to be in good agreement with ATcT values and with our previous study on ethanol.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4608&context=uop_etds,2019,-9.199196,1.086333,Roaming Transition States and Highly Accurate Thermochemistry A PEPICO Study of Two Small Combustion Systems,"Covert, K."

However, premature drug leakage is one of the major reasons for inefficient drug delivery of nanocarriers to the tumor. Drug diffusion out of the nanocarriers or destabilization of drug loaded nanocarriers by physiological interactions with blood cells, serum proteins, and cell membranes upon systemic administration contribute to premature drug release. In this study, targeted micelles, liposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) of similar composition were prepared and characterized to compare physicochemical characteristics, in vitro stability, in vitro release rates in release media and in vivo performance. Peptide Amphiphiles (PAs) formed micelles with critical micelle concentration (CMC) values ranging between 23.68 ± 0.72 µM to 38.76 ± 2.27 µM. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images confirmed the self-assembly of PAs into spherical structures where the largest sizes were seen for C16-(PEG2)6-LDV micelles. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) results confirmed the presence of targeted liposomes and SLNs with sizes smaller than 100 nm. Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) studies revealed that targeted micelles, liposomes and SLNs were all stable upon dilution in aqueous medium, however the stability was significantly reduced in human serum, with micelles being the least stable and SLNs being the most stable. The same trend was observed for the in vitro release profiles, where targeted paclitaxel-loaded micelles (PTX-micelles) had the fastest release rate and paclitaxel-loaded SLNs (PTX-SLN) exhibited the slowest release rate. DLS results showed that sizes of PTX-SLNs were smaller than PTX-liposomes (80.53 ± 5.37 nm vs 123.31 ± 5.87 nm). Cryogenic TEM observation showed increasing size in the order of PTX-micelles (6 to 12 nm) < PTX-SLNs (10-120 nm) < PTX-liposomes (48-145 nm). Drug Loading Content (DLC) of PTX-SLNs was greater than PTX-micelles and PTX-liposomes (7.45 ± 0.41 % vs 1.70 ± 0.42 % and 0.92 ± 0.09 %). Compared to initial aqueous dispersions, reconstituted spray dried formulations maintained their nanosize and paclitaxel content over 7 days at 4⁰C. In A375 melanoma xenograft mouse model, the tumor volumes were significantly smaller for mice treated with PTX-SLNs compared to the control group.

This can be especially deleterious for capital breeding carnivores, such as marine mammals, which rely on lipid stores accrued during intensive foraging to sustain prolonged periods of fasting associated with reproduction. Therefore, chronic stress may cause a decrease in fitness in these animals, leading to population declines and potentially detrimental shifts in food web dynamics as a result. However, the impacts and indicators of chronic stress in animals are currently poorly understood. To identify downstream mediators of repeated stress responses in marine mammals, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was administered once daily for four days to free-ranging juvenile northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) to stimulate endogenous corticosteroid release. I then compared blubber tissue transcriptome responses to the first and fourth ACTH administrations to determine the effects of acute and chronic endocrine stress, respectively. Gene expression profiles showed differences in responses to single and repeated ACTH administration, despite similarities in circulating cortisol profiles. We identified 61 and 12 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to the first ACTH and fourth administrations, respectively, 24 DEGs between the first and fourth pre-ACTH samples, and 12 DEGs between ACTH response samples from the first and fourth days. Annotated DEGs were associated with functions in redox and lipid homeostasis, suggesting potential negative impacts of repeated stress on marine mammals. In addition, protein expression profiles were discrete between single and repeated ACTH administrations, and identified changes in expression of extracellular proteins that were not detected at the transcriptome level. We identified 8 and 7 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in response to the first and fourth ACTH administrations, respectively, including 5 DEPs in the overall ACTH response, 1 DEP between the first and fourth pre-ACTH samples, and 10 DEPs between ACTH response samples from the first and fourth days. Differentially expressed proteins in response to repeated ACTH administrations were associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and suggest a link between glucocorticoid-induced adipogenesis and ECM remodeling in blubber. Other differentially expressed proteins were associated with increased lipid metabolism and decreased immunity, consistent with transcriptome data. Together, the use of transcriptomics and proteomics to detect responses to repeated stress provides more comprehensive insight into the marine mammal stress response and highlights the importance of using multiple discovery-driven approaches for understanding stress physiology. The gene and protein markers identified in this study may be used to identify stressed animals and discriminate between acutely and chronically stressed individuals with higher sensitivity than hormone measurements alone.",Biological Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4579&context=uop_etds,2019,-5.10462,-16.47717,Blubber transcriptome and proteome responses to repeated adrenocorticotropic hormone administration in a marine mammal,"Deyarmin, J."

This thesis complicates that discourse by analyzing the websites of five different San Francisco Bay Area gleaning groups to investigate how they present themselves as fitting into the larger conversation surrounding food charity, health, and food waste. This thesis uses qualitative and quantitative textual analysis to show how the language used on each organization’s website illustrates the organization’s relationship with those three values. Each organization presents itself as fitting into contemporary food recovery discourse in a different way: one focuses primarily on community building; one is looking to expand its model as far as possible; one seeks to be a solution to poor nutrition, food insecurity, and food waste in its community; one provides myriad resources to anyone looking; and one actively embraces the food insecure. The differences among these organizations show the one-dimensionality of the current discourse surrounding gleaning as a single solution to food insecurity, poor nutrition, and food waste. While gleaning can, and does, have value, its focus on the individual’s role in solving food insecurity, poor nutrition, and food waste, as well as its inability to provide long-term solutions, complicates its role in contemporary food recovery.",Other,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4612&context=uop_etds,2019,-3.7407975,-3.0865183,Kinder and Less Just A Critical Analysis of Modern Gleaning Organizations and Their Place in Food Recovery Discourse,"Gorman, A."

WNV is a zoonotic disease that is endemic in North America and is known to primarily cause flu-like symptoms in humans, and in rare cases, life-threatening conditions. The goal of this study was to identify which animal species are most frequently fed upon by these mosquitoes in this region. To examine the relationship between blood-feeding patterns and West Nile virus activity in San Bernardino County, the feeding patterns of Cx. quinquefasciatus are determined in a variety of habitat types, which was the primary focus of this study. Furthermore, potential shifts in seasonal blood-feeding patterns of this population of Cx. quinquefasciatus towards increased mammalian feeding was examined. The WNV activity in the county during 2011 was also analyzed. Over 740 Cx. quinquefasciatus samples were collected by West Valley Mosquito and Vector Control District in San Bernardino County during 2011 from 34 different sites. DNA from the bloodmeals was extracted and purified, and a 658-base pair region of DNA located in the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c-oxidase I (COI) was amplified. This was followed by DNA sequencing of the PCR product, and identification of the individual sequences using the Bar Code of Life Data Systems. A total of 683 bloodmeals were successfully identified. These bloodmeals belong to 29 vertebrate species across four different habitats. It was found that species richness was not significantly different between habitats, even though the sample sizes for each habitat varied. Across habitats, the highest percentage of avian bloodmeals were taken from House Sparrows and House Finches. Bloodmeals were identified from five mammalian species which included Humans. A seasonal shift towards increased mammalian bloodmeal prevalence was observed in urban habitats. It was found that WNV activity during 2011 in San Bernardino County was relatively low when compared to the following six years.",Biological Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4613&context=uop_etds,2019,-4.9442964,-15.150659,"Characterization of the blood-feeding patterns of Culex quinquefasciatus in San Bernadino County, California","Guinn, A."

In this research, a sequence of hierarchical mixed logistic regression models is applied to a unique data set from 2016 and 2017 NCAA men’s water polo seasons to analyze the relationship between goal generating tactics and different shooting positions. The primary result reveals that the closer a player is the “midline” of the pool and the closer a player is to the goal, the higher the percentage of scoring by offensive tactic. Furthermore, statistically significant relationships reveal (i) direct shots are better than perimeter shots, (ii) left-handed shooters are more efficient at scoring goals that right-handed shooters, and (iii) counterattack opportunities are better than power plays (player advantage).

Cells respond to ER stress by activating a signaling pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR induces phosphorylation of eIF2α to attenuate global protein translation, allowing the ER to clear misfolded proteins. Opposing this function, eIF2α phosphatases contain a catalytic subunit, Protein Phosphatase 1, and either of two homologous scaffolding subunits, GADD34 and CReP. Inhibition of eIF2α phosphatases has been shown to prolong UPR signaling and promote survival in many cells types and has reduced the progression of neurodegenerative diseases in several mouse models. Despite the clinical significance of GADD34 and CReP, their precise roles in UPR signaling and ER stress-induced apoptosis are largely unknown. Zebrafish are an ideal model for studying eIF2ɑ phosphatases in the UPR due to the efficiency of reverse genetics and the susceptibility of the caudal fin epidermal cells to ER stress-induced apoptosis. In acute ER stress, these cells undergo apoptosis mediated by p63-puma, but under chronic stress, apoptosis is mediated by CHOP, a downstream UPR target. We sought to determine the role of eIF2α phosphatases in both apoptotic programs by inducing eIF2α phosphatase loss- or gain-of-function and measuring the effect on apoptosis in response to ER stress. Inhibition of both eIF2ɑ phosphatases protected cells against both apoptotic responses, primarily through GADD34 inhibition. We speculate that survival is promoted through enhanced eIF2ɑ phosphorylation, stalling the UPR in an early state and preventing accumulation of the late-stage target, CHOP. GADD34 overexpression protected cells against acute apoptosis, which we hypothesize is through a transient promotion of autophagy. Our results indicate that altering the influence of eIF2α phosphatases in the UPR may be a promising therapeutic for diseases exacerbated by ER stress.",Biological Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4616&context=uop_etds,2019,-16.041126,-13.160563,Characterization of the roles of PPP1R15A (GADD34) and PPP1R15B (CReP) in ER stress-induced apoptosis in vivo,"Hicks, D."

Therefore, urban animals may be particularly susceptible to warming associated with ongoing climate change. Thus, I used a comparative and manipulative approach to test three related hypotheses about the determinants of heat tolerance or critical thermal maximum (CTmax) in urban ants—specifically, that (1) body size, (2) hydration status, and (3) preferred micro-environments influence CTmax. I further tested a fourth hypothesis that native species are particularly physiologically vulnerable in urban environments. I manipulated water access and determined CTmax for 11 species common to cities in California's Central Valley that exhibit nearly 300-fold variation in body mass. Inter- (but not intra-) specific variation in body size influenced CTmax where larger species had higher CTmax. The sensitivity of ants’ CTmax to water availability exhibited species-specific thresholds where short-term water limitation (8 h) reduced CTmax in some species while longer-term water limitation (32 h) was required to reduce CTmax in other species. However, CTmax was not influenced by the preferred foraging temperatures of ants. Further, I did not find support for my fourth hypothesis because native species did not exhibit reduced thermal safety margins, or exhibit CTmax values that were more sensitive to water limitation relative to non-native species. In sum, understanding the links between heat tolerance and water availability will become critically important in an increasingly warm, dry, and urbanized world that may be selecting for smaller (not larger) body size.",Biological Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4574&context=uop_etds,2019,-4.94785,-11.646378,City limits Heat tolerance is influenced by body size and hydration state in an urban ant community,"Johnson, D."

However, intervention analyses, indicate an overall decrease in levels of MVPA. This limitation could hinder further improvements of function-based interventions to increase physical activity, and is thus important to investigate. The current study partially replicated Zerger et al.

Additionally, the current study also evaluated the effectiveness of a more intermittent contingent schedules of reinforcement (i.e., fixed-interval limited-hold schedule) during intervention conditions. Results suggest it might be beneficial for caretakers and parents to deliver reinforcement in the form of social reinforcement to increase MVPA in preschool children.

Four methods for collecting secretions containing pheromone in Hymenochirus sp. were tested: norepinephrine injection, gonadotropin-releasing hormone injection, homogenization of gland tissue, and electrostimulation of the skin over the breeding gland area.  The samples collected were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry.  The HPLC chromatograph for the male norepinephrine sample contained a peak at 6.4 min that was not in the female norepinephrine sample HPLC chromatograph.  The male norepinephrine sample mass spectrum had a peak of m/z 292.0 not in the female norepinephrine sample mass spectrum.  Breeding gland homogenate mass spectra showed major peaks with m/z values of 203.9, 245.2, 484.8, and 558.9.  The male norepinephrine sample mass spectrum contained peaks with the same m/z values, but the female norepinephrine sample did not.  Serotonin and a novel truncated hymenochirin were found in male and female samples collected using norepinephrine or GnRH injection.  HPLC results showed that electrostimulation of male frogs, as performed in this study, did not cause secretion of as many chemical compounds as the other methods.  Electrical stimulation was done with a voltage of 0.75 V and stainless steel electrodes, instead of the 4.1 V and platinum electrodes used in other studies.  The current produced was likely insufficient to stimulate the breeding gland.  Behavioral testing was conducted testing female attraction to males injected with GnRH, and certain HPLC fractions of the male norepinephrine and breeding gland homogenate samples.

There are roughly 300,000 rib fractures treated for in the United States each year. These represent 10-26% of thoracic trauma injuries and have about a 10% mortality rate. There is a common belief that mortality in rib fracture patients can be contributed to the diagnosis of pneumonia, but this study does not support that claim. Purpose. To determine the predictors of morbidity and mortality in rib fracture patients. Methods. Using a level 1 trauma center patient registry, we retrospectively analyzed all patients that were admitted with at least one rib fracture (n=1,344). All predictors were analyzed with linear regressions. Results. The average age of the patients was 55.48 ± 20.29 years old and ranged between 15 and 98. ISS (OR: 1.0508, p<0.001), bilateral fractures (OR: 1.9495, p = 0.009) and pulmonary contusion (OR: 1.7481, p = 0.022) were all significant predictors of pneumonia. The age of the patient (OR: 1.0467, p < 0.001), ISS (OR: 1.0585, p <0.001), having 6 or more fractured ribs (OR: 3.1450, p < 0.001), the presence of hemothorax (OR: 2.5063, p = 0.048), and the use of mechanical ventilation (OR: 13.2125, p < 0.001) were all significant predictors of mortality. Flail segments (OR: 1.9871, p = 0.067), ISS (OR: 1.1267, p < 0.001), pulmonary contusions (OR: 1.5329, p = 0.047), pneumothorax (OR: 1.4372, p =0.073) and pneumonia (OR: 21.4516, p < 0.001) are all predictors of requiring mechanical ventilation. Conclusion. There are many studies that indicate rib fracture patients who are diagnosed with pneumonia have a higher risk or mortality. With this in mind, the logical course of treatment would be to counteract the complications pneumonia brings as to reduce the risk or mortality. To do this, it is recommend the patient be put on mechanical ventilation. While this has been seen to help with pneumonia patients, this study provides evidence that health care professionals should look for ways to reduce the need for mechanical ventilation instead of using it to combat the pneumonia.",Health and Sport Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4553&context=uop_etds,2019,-14.409146,6.320481,Predictors of Morbidity and Mortality Among Thoracic Trauma Patients,"McConnell, J."

Physical inactivity is also a key risk factor for noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes (WHO, 2018).  Globally, 1 in 4 adults is not active enough and, therefore, foregoes a myriad of health benefits associated with Physical Activity (PA; WHO, 2018).  In the United States, only about 1 in 5 (21%) adults meet the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2018).  The CDC currently recommends adults engage in 150 min of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week (CDC, 2018).  Translated to steps, the recommendation can be met by taking 3,000 steps in 30 min, 5 days per week (Marshall et al., 2009).  Physical inactivity is also a major contributor to obesity (WHO, 2018).  According to the WHO (2018), worldwide prevalence of obesity almost tripled since 1975.  In the United States, the medical costs of obesity were estimated to be $147 billion, or 10% of all medical spending (Finkelstein, Trogdon, Cohen, & Dietz, 2009).  To combat the many problems associated with physical inactivity, the CDC (2015), the WHO (2018), and the American Heart Association (2018) prescribe increased PA.  Furthermore, increased PA contributes to a variety of other health benefits, including a decreased risk for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, some cancers, as well as improved mental health, and increased life expectancy (CDC, 2018).",Educational and School Psychology,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4587&context=uop_etds,2019,-4.0176406,-14.901619,Effects of a group-deposit prize draw on the step counts of adults,"McCurdy, A."

Reporting the near miss incident type in which no injury or damage to equipment or the environment occurs is buttressed by the assumption that both the worker and the organization ascribe to the same goal to identify workplace hazards and prevent incident recurrence. The goal of incident reporting is not apparent, and the path to achieving the goal is obstructed by internal and external hazards that act to oppose the reporting process, such that the goals are obscured by competing priorities. The general qualitative method was applied to a nonrandom snowball sampling technique to recruit eight participants. Over 176 years of combined experience across aircraft maintenance and petrochemical operations are represented. Participants were removed from either industry within the last five years. Each participant experienced multiple near miss incident events in the past. At the time an incident occurs, the compelling individual need that exists is explained in terms of Abraham Maslow’s (1943) theory of motivation. The Process- Practice-Purpose principle is developed and used to demonstrate the association between activities (the “what”) that occur within workspaces and customary practices (the “how”) that develop in the course of realizing the incident reporting goal. Three recurring themes support the findings: (a) The motivation to report, (b) Beliefs about reporting, and (c) The purpose of 7 reporting over time. Together, the themes form the three-legged stool of the incident reporting perception. Any leg missing renders the stool out of balance. Hazards are identified in terms of personal safety. The near miss definition is expressed in terms of individual perspective and is guided by experience, personality, knowledge, and personal agency to take action. The goal of reporting is explained in terms of benefit to people, the process, and practice. Alignment with the OHSA goal is evaluated by examining the motivation to report, beliefs about reporting, and the purpose of reporting over time. The Principle of Understanding partnership model is developed to engage the worker and the organization in active learning from near miss incidents through awareness and knowledge about the cumulative utility of near miss data, perceptions of incident severity, and optimizing communication.",Education,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4651&context=uop_etds,2019,15.579398,15.571789,NEAR MISS REPORTING PERSPECTIVES ON WORKER CONVERSANCE OF INCIDENT EVENTS ACROSS TWO INDUSTRIES,"McGee, J."

Retention efforts to date have not included strategies to address Compassion Fatigue (burnout and secondary trauma) teachers experience when working with traumatized students at urban schools.  This dissertation explores whether Compassion Fatigue is an unaddressed reason for teacher attrition at urban schools.  A mixed method practical action research approach using the Professional Quality of Life Scale Version Five (ProQOL 5) and qualitative interviews, portions of which were turned into illustrative vignettes drove the exploration.  Approximately 114 teachers completed the ProQOL 5.  Statistical analysis of the ProQOL 5 results showed that female teachers experience more compassion fatigue than male teachers; compassion fatigue is more acute with beginning teachers than with veteran teachers; and that teachers working at high-poverty schools experience statistically significant differences in compassion satisfaction and fatigue than teachers at low poverty schools.  Correlation tests revealed statistically significant relationships between compassion fatigue and the school’s racial demographics even when controlling for the socioeconomically disadvantaged status of the school and teacher ethnicity.  Linear regression models showed that the percentage of African American students in the school is a statistically significant predictor of compassion fatigue.  Qualitative interview analysis showed that secondary trauma from students is not the only trauma teachers are experiencing, and that school climate and conditions matter when attempting to retain teachers.  In the final phase of the action research, a policy brief was developed through a collaborative and iterative process, based both on the findings and engagement with stakeholders.

In 1928, Sunset was purchased by Lawrence Lane, a Midwestern magazine executive who transformed it from a failing turn-of-the-century, general interest publication about the West, into a successful magazine about living in the West for the Western middle-class. Sunset had always been a magazine for men and women, and one that appealed to both male and female intellectuals at the time Lane purchased it. Lane and his editors attempted to interject more rigid middle-class ideals into a magazine that had espoused ideas that were progressive and less structured. Lane's new strategy to compartmentalize Sunset's content into its four categories—gardening, the home, cooking, and travel—resulted in a magazine that was conventionally gendered. Tension due to this shift played out in the publication's new cooking department. This thesis traces the development of Sunset's cooking department between 1928 and 1938 under the direction of its creator and founding editor Genevieve Callahan through the examination and analysis of Sunset cooking features and oral histories. The original department, structured to model a middle-class domestic ideology, did not accommodate all of Sunset's readers. The Western intellectualism of pre-Lane readers and their tendency to be less bound by conventional gender roles in the kitchen carried over into Sunset's cooking department via reader recipe contributions. These Western cooks included men and women whose foodways deviated from that of the typical middle-class housewife. Callahan experimented throughout the cooking department's first decade by shifting its editorial framework and softening her home economics rigidity to create a department that was inclusive of women and men who cooked both inside and outside the kitchen. The changes made to the department over that decade illustrate how editorial experimentation reconciled a new middle-class-oriented cooking department to accommodate Western cooks less apt to model traditional gender roles.",Other,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4573&context=uop_etds,2019,1.1687869,4.9713755,The evolution of Sunset Magazine's cooking department The accommodation of men's and women's cooking in the 1930s,"Pagano, J."

Ligand-targeted drugs (LTDs) are a promising class of targeted anticancer agents.  The hydrophilicity of the targeting ligands in LTDs limits its nonselective passive tissue distribution and toxicity to healthy cells.  In addition, the small size of LTDs allows for better tumor penetration, especially in the case of solid tumors.  However, the short circulation half-life of LTDs, due to their hydrophilicity and small size, remains a significant challenge for achieving their full therapeutic potential.  Therefore, extending the circulation half-life of targeted chemotherapeutic agents while maintaining their hydrophilicity and small size will represent a significant advance towards effective and safe cancer treatment.  Here, we present a new approach for enhancing the safety and efficacy of targeted chemotherapeutic agents.  By endowing hydrophobic chemotherapeutic agents with a targeting moiety and a hydrophilic small molecule that binds reversibly to the serum protein transthyretin, we generated small hydrophilic drug conjugates that displayed enhanced circulation half-life in rodents and selectivity to cancer cells.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a successful approach that maintains the small size and hydrophilicity of targeted anticancer agents containing hydrophobic payloads, while at the same time extending their circulation half-life.

As technological developments permit new methods of measuring this effect, it is important to validate existing paradigms. The purpose was to determine if kinetic measurements from vertical jump (VJ) tests are influenced by fatigue based on explosive power outputs. A sample of athletes (9 men, 26 women) from a Division I NCAA sports program completed testing. To establish baseline VJ kinetics, athletes performed a controlled warm-up and then completed six jumps using Sparta Science technology, each separated by 15s rest. Sparta software computed three force outputs: Load, Explode and Drive. After baseline VJ calculation, performed an anaerobic fatigue protocol on a cycle ergometer: three 15s sprints separated by 10s rest. Max and average power were recorded from the cycle trials. Subjects then repeated the VJ protocol. This pattern was repeated until six sets of VJ were recorded. Repeated measures ANOVA tested differences between successive VJ performances. Male athletes were 20.8 ± 1.5years old, weighed 175.8 ± 14.0lbs, had a baseline VJ of 46.9 ± 3.6cm, Load of 53.6 ± 13.3, Explode of 49.4 ± 6.6, and Drive of 49.4 ± 11.9. Female athletes were 20.2 ± 1.2years old, weighed 142.3 ± 13.2lbs, had a baseline VJ of 32.7 ± 4.3cm, Load of 49.8 ± 46.1, Explode of 40.7 ± 8.0, and Drive of 63.1 ± 49.7. Differences between sex were weight (p <0.001), VJ (p <0.001), and Explode (p=0.006). ANOVA found VJ height to decrease between baseline and trial 2 (p <0.001), no difference between sex (p=0.210); and between trials 2 and 6 VJ height was consistent (p>0.400). Load was not affected by the fatigue protocol across the total sample (p=0.418) or by sex (p=0.239). Explode was not affected by fatigue across the sample (p=0.233) or by sex (p=0.406). Drive was affected by fatigue (p=0.040), decreasing in successive trials; no interaction with sex (p=0.742). VJ is more sensitive to fatigue than Sparta’s force plate calculations.

Stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, resulting in increased circulating glucocorticoid (GCs) hormones, which alter expression of target genes encoding metabolic enzymes and other mediators of stress. Prolonged HPA axis stimulation may increase catabolism of nutrient stores and suppress immune and reproductive functions, impacting the fitness of marine mammals. GCs measurements are used to identify wild animals experiencing stress. However, these measurements may not be sensitive enough to distinguish between an acutely and a chronically stressed individuals. In this study, we present a new approach of assessing stress states in marine mammals, by measuring expression levels of gene markers in blubber. We previously characterized transcriptional and metabolic profiles and identified genes and metabolites that were differentially expressed in response to single and repeated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) administration in juvenile northern elephant seals. We then measured expression of these target genes in blubber tissue collected from juvenile northern elephant seals in their natural baseline stress states (n=30), and correlated their gene expression values with cortisol, aldosterone, total triiodothyronine (tT3), reverse triiodothyronine (rT3), and triglyceride levels, and body condition index. We found that blubber genes that were upregulated in response to repeated ACTH administration in the previous study were positively correlated with cortisol and inversely correlated with tT3 in the baseline sample set. These markers included genes that encode a lipid particle protein (PLIN1), an adipogenesis promoting transcription factor (DKK1), an oxidative stress enzyme (GPX3), and a lipid metabolism enzyme (AZGP1). Blubber genes differentially expressed in response to acute ACTH administration in the previous study included an adipokine (ADIPOQ) and a ketogenesis enzyme (HMGCS2), which were upregulated, and an adipogenesis inhibitor, TGFBI, which was downregulated. ADIPOQ and HMGCS2 were positively correlated with cortisol and negatively correlated with tT3 levels, while TGFBI was positively correlated with tT3 and body condition index, and negatively correlated with rT3 in the baseline sample set. These results provide insights into the molecular mediators of the physiological stress response and provide markers that can be used as a part of a potential diagnostic panel for differentiating between acute and prolonged stress states in marine mammals.",Biological Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4590&context=uop_etds,2019,-5.2138224,-16.38358,Development of a biomarker panel for identifying stressed marine mammals,"Pujade, L."

In nature, dragline silk serves a central role during spider locomotion and web construction. Today, scientists are racing to elucidate the molecular machinery governing silk extrusion, attempting to translate this knowledge into a mimicry process in the laboratory to create synthetic fibers for a wide range of different applications. During extrusion, it has been established that biochemical and mechanical forces govern spidroin folding, aggregation, and assembly. In black widow spiders, at least 7 different proteins have been identified as constituents of dragline silk fibers. These represent the major ampullate spidroins, MaSp1 and MaSp2, and several low-molecular weight cysteine-rich protein (CRP) family members that include CRP1, CRP2, and CRP4.

To advance scientific knowledge regarding CRP function, we expressed and purified recombinant CRP1 and CRP4 from bacteria and investigated their secondary structure using circular dichroism (CD) under different chemical and physical conditions. We demonstrate by far-UV CD spectroscopy that CRP1 and CRP4 contain similar secondary structural characteristics in solution, displaying substantial amounts of random coil conformation, followed by lower levels of beta sheet, alpha helical and beta-turn structure.

Adaptive radiations often require considerable evidence in order to resolve the evolutionary relationships of closely related individuals. Previous studies of this genus have found paraphyly among species and have been unable to disentangle these taxa due to a lack of data and/or incomplete sampling of the genus. As a result, the interspecific relationships among Speyeria remain unresolved. In an attempt to achieve phylogenetic resolution of the genus, we conducted population genomic and phylogenomic analyses of all North American Speyeria species, as well as several subspecies, based on genome wide markers using the SbfI restriction enzyme and restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq). Together, our analyses recovered 16 species within Speyeria, validating previous taxonomic work. However, consistent with recent molecular analyses, internal relationships have poor support. This lack of resolution indicates Speyeria represent an ongoing adaptive radiation, with incomplete lineage sorting, hybridization, and lack of postzygotic reproductive barriers, supporting this hypothesis.",Biological Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4594&context=uop_etds,2019,-2.8773012,-18.977491,Phylogenomic analyses clarify butterfly species within the genus Speyeria despite evidence of a recent adaptive radiation,"Thompson, E."

Most of these approaches design new peptide ligands by connecting the crucial amino acid residues from the protein interface and are generally not based on any predicted receptor-ligand interaction. In this work, a peptide design method based on the Knob-Socket model was used to identify the specific ligand residues packing into the receptor interface. This method enables rational peptide ligand design by predicting amino acid residues that will fit best at the binding site of the receptor protein. Specific peptide ligands for the model receptor CD13 that are overexpressed in several cancer types were designed in this study. From the initial library of designed peptides, three potential candidates were selected based on simulated energies in the CD13 binding site using the programs Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) and AutoDock Vina. In the CD13 enzymatic activity inhibition assay, the three identified peptides exhibited 2.7 to 7.4 times lower IC50 values (GYPAY, 227 µM; GFPAY, 463 µM; GYPAVYLF, 170 µM) when compared to the known peptide ligand CNGRC(C1-C5) (1260 µM). The binding affinities of the peptides (GYPAY, Ki = 54.0 µM; GFPAY, Ki = 74.3 µM; GYPAVYLF, Ki = 38.8 µM) were 10 to 20 times higher than that of CNGRC (C1-C5) (Ki = 773 µM). The double reciprocal plots from the steady state enzyme kinetic assays confirmed the binding of the peptides to the intended active site of CD13. The cell binding and confocal microscopy assays showed that the designed peptides selectively bind to the CD13 on cell surface. The designed peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) showed lower in vitro cytotoxicity and slightly better in vivo antitumor efficacy as compared to a model drug MMAE.

This study explored damage resulting from interactions with environmental nucleophilic toxins, such as a variety of diols and amines found in industry.  These nucleophiles can react with electrophilic groups, such as 5-formylcytosine.  5-formylcytosine is an oxidation product of the epigenetic base 5-methylcytosine.  It is typically removed by thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) but is known to accumulate in the genome, making the formyl group susceptible to attack.  In this study we used GC/MS and ESI-MS to show that DNA lesions from the nucleophilic addition reaction of toxins and 5-formylcytosine can be formed under physiological conditions.  In addition, this formation showed a pH dependency, with lower pHs showing more product formation.  Studies with a lesion formed from the reaction of 1,3-propane diol and 5-formylcytosine showed that the lesion has little effect on the conformation of the DNA duplex.  UV thermal denaturation studies showed that at a glance the lesion also has little effect on the stability of the DNA duplex, however, more extensive studies revealed a slight destabilization effect due to the lesion.  Enzymatic studies showed that the presence of one lesion does not have a significant effect on the ability of DNA polymerase to efficiently complete DNA replication with high fidelity, but when the lesion was incorrectly base paired, the extension reactions resulted in deletion products or a halt in replication.  Addition of a second tandem lesion to the template resulted in a decrease in fidelity, while continuing to give deletion products and replication stops in the presence of mismatched base pairs.  This is particularly significant, indicating the potential for the lesion to be mutagenic or even cytotoxic.  Lesions formed from other environmental toxins could be even more damaging, making them well worth future investigation.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4537&context=uop_etds,2018,-16.243639,-8.159582,DNA Lesions Produced from the Reaction of Diols and 5-Formylcytosine and Their Effects on DNA Replication,"Allen, B."

This poses the question of whether this dimorphism arises due to sexual selection in order to increase reproductive success or rather from ecological selection as a result of sex-specific niche partitioning.  In this case, we study an organism that displays a drastic form of sexual dimorphism, in that the males have large complex lateral eyes whereas the females lack eyes and merely have rudimentary lateral eye-spots.  Euphilomedes carcharodonta is a small crustacean native to the coast of California.  Studies on the dimorphism between these individuals have mainly been related to genetics and embryology.  However, minimal studies have been performed questioning the evolutionary driving force behind their dimorphism.  One study suggests that this driving force is ecological selection, more specifically, predator evasion as a result of the reproductive role hypothesis.  In this study, we focus on sexual selection as a driving force and ask whether the eyes play a role in the ability of males to find mates.  We blinded and mock-blinded male individuals, placed them in tank settings with females in the absence of predators, and observed their behavior.  If sexual selection is involved in the eye development of males, we expected to see changes in male and/or female behavior in response to obstructing the vision of the males.  We did not see changes in behavior of the males or the females.  This leads us to conclude that the development of complex eyes in male Euphilomedes carcharodonta arises from ecological selection rather than sexual selection.  With the previous work on predator evasion, these experiments and findings are the first to experimentally test the reproductive role hypothesis and are the beginning steps for further behavioral studies of these organisms and in discovering more about the unique dimorphism exhibited by Euphilomedes carcharodonta.",Biological Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4107&context=uop_etds,2018,-3.595721,-19.027107,Behavioral Patterns of Blinded vs. Mock-blinded Male Individuals in the Presence of Females Analysis of the Role of Eyes in Euphilomedes carcharodonta Mating,"Arenz, A."

Because college students use social media so often, it would be incumbent for the researcher to examine the impact Donald Trump’s tweets might have on these young adults’, civic engagement and how the tweets may be affecting his perceived credibility and expertise. The researcher administered a questionnaire to 350 college students from a private medium sized west coast university using various modified scales examining credibility, expertise and civic engagement. Civic engagement was measured using an adapted version of several civic engagement instruments. The researcher used a correlation analysis to offer answers for the proposed research questions. It was found that Donald Trump’s tweets have a significant positive impact on the way college students perceive him to be credible while also effecting their perception of his level of expertise. The tweets did not indicate a correlation to civic engagement, but further research concluded that specific tweets have the ability to have a significant negative correlation on civic attitudes and behaviors. The correlation analysis also found that there was a significant negative correlation between which form of media students use the most and their civic engagement. A regression analysis was performed to see if the tweets had predicting power on college student perception of his credibility and expertise. The tweets demonstrated predicting power. A regression analysis was done to see if the tweets had predicting power on college student civic engagement; the regression results showed no significant predicting power between the two.

Although this parasite is historically localized to regions closer to the equator, the last few decades have experienced an increase in the amount of dog heartworm cases in Northern California, most notably in Lake and San Joaquin Counties.  The primary vector of D. immitis in Northern California is Aedes sierrensis, but it is not prevalent enough in some counties to explain the increase in infections.  Because of this, more prevalent and abundant species should be assessed for their ability to transmit heartworm.  Culex pipiens complex (wild) and Culiseta incidens (laboratory-raised colonies) were chosen as potential vectors during this study due to their ability to meet several key vector criteria, their relative abundance in the areas of interest, and the fact that they habitually take bloodmeals from domestic dogs.  Additionally, Ae. sierrensis colonies were used in this study, based on previous knowledge that they are highly competent vectors.  Female mosquitoes were infected with 2.5, 5, or 10 mff/ul of D. immitis-infected blood, and decapitated at 15, 18, and 21 days post-infection.  Mosquitoes were subsequently tested via qPCR for the presence and relative quantification of D. immitis DNA.  We found that Ae. sierrensis and Cx. pipiens complex were both able to support the development of D. immitis to its infective stage, while Cs. incidens was not a competent vector.  We also concluded that including a standard curve of known amounts of D. immitis larvae makes it possible to approximate the intensity of the infection in the mosquito.

Although scholars have examined predictors of student interest and engagement within the classroom setting, it has yet to be examined in correlation with an instructor’s use of humor.  More specifically, student intellectual stimulation is rarely studied on its own, especially in relation to an instructor’s humor orientation.  This study seeks to determine if an instructors humor orientation acts a predictor of student intellectual stimulation, engagement, and interest within the college classroom setting.  This study obtained data from a sample of 337 full-time college students at two Northern California Universities.  Data was collected through a self-administered paper and pencil questionnaire.  Six sections of the questionnaire subsequently measured students’ perceptions of an instructor’s humor orientation, student intellectual stimulation, student interest, student engagement, demographic information on the participant, as well as the instructor that they were reporting on.  The Humor Orientation scale was used to measure the dimensions of the instructor’s humor use within the classroom.  The Student Intellectual Stimulation Scale (SISS) was used to examine the instructors use of intellectual stimulation within the classroom.  Last, the student Interest and Engagement scales were utilized to measure the how interested and engaged students were within the reported course.  This study found a statistically significant positive relationship amongst an instructors use of humor orientation and their ability to intellectually stimulate, engage, and interest students within the course.  More specifically, an instructors use of humor within the classroom acted as a predictor to students being more intellectually stimulated, interested, and engaged within that given course.  Furthermore, this study is of significance because it suggests that an instructor that uses humor within the classroom setting, will not only help intellectually stimulate their students, but they will also help enhance their interest, and engagement within the course, which can possibly lead to heightened cognitive and affective learning.  Thus, instructors that are perceived to be funny within their respective course, are more likely to have students that are intellectually stimulated, interested, and engaged which enhances learning.",Other,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4116&context=uop_etds,2018,5.605158,-2.8036053,"Student Perceptions of Instructor Humor as a Predictor of Student Intellectual Stimulation, Academic Interest and Engagement","Freitas, T."

Over time their size and scope expanded significantly alongside growing food insecurity.  As government entitlement programs continue to erode, the ensuing institutionalization of food banks secured their future.  Yet scholars such as sociologist Janet Poppendieck argued over twenty years ago that these charitable programs inadvertently prevent the government from reassuming responsibility by providing the public the illusion of a solution despite their inability to adequately meet the need.  This research argues that food bank advocacy can be used to reduce hunger and address its root cause—poverty.  A case study analysis of the advocacy programs of the San Francisco-Marin and Alameda County Community Food Banks describes how their advocacy work, in practice, addresses both Poppendieck’s and contemporary food bank critiques.  This analysis illustrates how both case study organizations built their advocacy programs on a foundation of public food program outreach—redirecting their clients to government programs—but now affect change through divergent approaches.  San Francisco employs a top-down government system reform and technical assistance model.  Alameda’s bottom-up social justice model reaches past food programs to broader anti-poverty advocacy.

Understanding this progress begins by analyzing ELLs’ growth trajectories through progress monitoring of interventions in order to timely identify, through a data driven method, if lack of anticipated ELLs’ progress requires further examination. Results suggested ELLs in this study were able to make positive growth within the same time frame as their English only peers albeit with different patterns of growth for each group.",Educational and School Psychology,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4118&context=uop_etds,2018,8.518325,-10.01438,RATE OF GROWTH IN SPANISH-SPEAKING ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS RECEIVING INTERVENTION THROUGH MULTITIERED SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT,"Gilbert, D."

Thus, experiments manipulating multiple environmental factors provide valuable insight into the role of the environment in shaping not only important traits (e.g., dispersal capacity or reproduction), but also trait-trait interactions (e.g., trade-offs between traits). We employed a multi-factorial design to manipulate variation in temperature (constant 28°C vs. 28±5°C daily cycle) and food availability (unlimited vs. intermittent access) throughout development in the sand field cricket, Gryllus firmus. We found that fitness-related, life-history traits and trait trade-offs can be developmentally plastic in response to variation in temperature and food availability. Variability in temperature and food availability influenced development, growth, body size, reproductive investment, and/or flight capacity, and food availability also affected survival to adulthood. Further, both constant temperature and unlimited food availability promoted investment into key components of somatic and reproductive tissues while reducing investment into flight capacity. We develop an experimental and statistical framework to reveal shifts in correlative patterns of investment into different life-history traits. This approach can be applied to a range of animal systems to investigate how environmental complexity influences traits and trait trade-offs.",Biological Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4530&context=uop_etds,2018,-15.610901,4.828415,Should I stay or should I go?

In this study, I explore the socio-historical development of outdoor recreational spaces, existing environmental habitus and African Americans lived experiences in outdoor recreation. To emphasize the voice of the participants, twelve African American millennials were interviewed. Questions in the interviews revolved around their perception of outdoor recreation and personal experiences while participating in outdoor recreation. Three overarching themes emerged from their stories, i) the typology of outdoor recreation, ii) outdoor recreation as a White activity and, iii) the role of environmental trauma. Upon exploring these themes, the conclusion was made that the participants did connect the socio-historical development of outdoor recreational spaces, existing environmental habitus and their lived experiences in outdoor recreation. Their connection led me to the conclusion that the low participation rates of African Americans in outdoor recreation is a complicated social phenomena that is connected to multiple facets of oppression. I then broke these facets of oppression into three tiers, i), the construction and maintenance of outdoor recreation as a White activity, and the Whiteness that is embedded deeply within the outdoor recreation configuration, ii), the history of financial and economic marginalization that communities of color have endured in the United States and iii), the environmental trauma that African Americans have experienced in outdoor settings throughout American history.

Production of the chuck involves vibrating a pair of laryngeal fibrous masses that is attached to the vocal cords. The muscular control of this mechanism remains unknown. Recent studies revealed a split in the laryngeal dilator muscle, which unveiled the deep dilator as a novel laryngeal muscle with unique attachments, innervation, and (likely) function. The deep dilator may position the fibrous masses for chuck production. The goals of this study were 1) to confirm the innervation of the novel muscle through electrophysiology; and 2) to determine the action of each laryngeal muscle (including the deep dilator), in isolation and in combination with one another, to elucidate the control of laryngeal function. I stimulated 32 combinations of the five laryngeal muscles electrically with 3-5 repetitions. Using suction glass electrodes, I stimulated the branches of the laryngeal nerves in excised larynges maintained in saline solution and filmed the resulting movements to measure their displacement due to stimulation. The results showed that the novel muscle is exclusively innervated by the short laryngeal nerve, a condition equivalent to that of the mammalian posterior cricoarytenoid muscle, responsible for opening the vocal cords. Also, contraction of the deep dilator muscle is required and sufficient to produce lateral displacement of the fibrous masses and, therefore, to create a chuck. This identifies the deep dilator as a key element in the evolution of call complexity in túngara frogs. Clarifying the mechanism that controls the addition of chucks to the túngara frog call is an important step in understanding the evolution of signal complexity in animal communication systems. The recognition of the mechanism may allow comparative studies to be made that can reveal why complex calling evolved in the túngara frog lineage while not in others.",Biological Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3989&context=uop_etds,2018,-12.278471,-4.8864517,NEUROMUSCULAR CONTROL OF THE CALLING APPARATUS IN THE TÚNGARA FROG (ENGYSTOMOPS PUSTULOSUS),"Grewal, K."

Anne Theresa Demo’s analysis on the Guerilla Girls’ comic politics of subversion offers an appropriate conceptual lens to analyze Banksy’s employment of perspectives by incongruity as strategies for subversion. Therefore, this thesis analyzes how Banksy’s subversive satire is rhetorical by examining three techniques that have successfully exposed hegemonic institutions: mimicry, revision, and juxtaposition. Further, I argue that Banksy’s street art gallery, Better Out Than In, utilized these techniques in a global, revolutionary manner to bolster access and widen audience participation. Banksy’s street art both spotlights contemporary injustices and provides a frame to interpret the artist’s critical perspectives.

This study uses community cookbooks to look beyond domestic roles and to trace changing foodways during the period from 1870 to 1930 in the northern Central Valley of California.  Nine cookbooks from Sacramento, California and five cookbooks from Stockton, California reveal changes in foodways during this time.  Recipes, text, and advertisements in these cookbooks show changes in the manner of home food production; a loss of pre-industrial food knowledge; increasing standardization in recipes and cooking knowledge; and an increasing reliance on commercially processed and name brand foods.  These changes indicate a growing population and shifting demographics.  The results provide insight into differences between urban and rural foodways as urban populations grow.  The intrusion of industrialized food into rural home cooking may provide a backdrop for contemporary understanding of urban foodways.  Researchers seeking to understand how commercial foods become entrenched in modern foodways can use community cookbooks to trace back the introduction and assimilation of commercially processed foods in the past.

These increases did not vary in magnitude between the first ACTH challenge on day 1 and the last challenge on day 4. In contrast, aldosterone levels remained elevated above baseline for at least 24 hours after each ACTH injection (p < 0.001), and responses were greater on day 4 than day 1 (p < 0.01). Total triiodothyronine (tT3) levels were decreased on day 4 relative to day 1 (p < 0.01), while reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) concentrations increased relative to baseline on days 1 and 4 (p < 0.001) in response to ACTH, indicating a suppression of thyroid hormone secretion. There was no effect of ACTH on the sex steroid dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). These results suggest that elephant seals are able to mount adrenal responses to multiple ACTH challenges. However, repeated stress results in facilitation of aldosterone secretion and suppression of tT3, which may impact osmoregulation and metabolism. We propose that aldosterone and tT3 are informative additional indicators of repeated stress in marine mammals.",Biological Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4126&context=uop_etds,2018,-4.7274175,-12.309275,Endocrine responses to repeated adrenocorticotropic hormone administration in free-ranging elephant,"McCormley, M."

Aluminum alloy reinforced with silicon carbide particles is a type of particle metal matrix composite that has seen applications in the aerospace, ground transportation, and electronics industry. However, the abrasive SiC particles have made this material difficult to machine through conventional machining strategies. This research will focus on using computer aided manufacturing with trochoidal tool paths to maximize machining productivity and extend the tool life of CVD diamond coated end mills. The focus of this research will be on AlSiCp with a high volume fraction of reinforcement (30%) to expand the potential applications of this pMMC. The cutting experiments are divided into three parts: cutting test, confirmation test, and endurance test. Taguchi method will be used to perform an analysis of variance and signal-to-noise ratio to optimize a combination of material removal rate, average cutting forces, and surface roughness. The optimal cutting conditions were found to be 254 mm/min, 30°, and 9500 r/min for MRR+AvgFxy+Ra, 1524  mm/min, 30°, and 9500 r/min for MRR+AvgFxy, and 1524 mm/min, 90°, and 9500 r/min. The cutting conditions for MRR+AvgFx+Ra was not considered for the endurance tests as the machining productivity was too low to be considered a feasible option in the industry. It was concluded that trochoidal milling under wet cutting conditions produced nearly half the tool wear as previous research with conventional milling strategies. However, the longer the CVD diamond coated end mills were engaged in the AlSiCp workpiece, the more dominant the abrasive wear mechanisms appear and cause tool damage. It was concluded that square end mills may not be suitable for machining AlSiCp and that future research should focus on varying the tool geometry or utilizing ball end mills.",Engineering,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4127&context=uop_etds,2018,-9.526233,0.82970023,Trochoidal Milling of AlSiCp with CVD Diamond Coated End Mills,"Nguyen, T."

Active learning focuses on involving students in the learning process more directly compared to traditional methods.  Another method which infuses both a performative background with an academic footing called performance pedagogy, emphasizes on the students bringing their ideologies, cultures, belief systems, and backgrounds into the classroom while incorporating their physical and metaphorical selves into the classroom space. The idea is that when students are exposed to these methods in a classroom setting, they can apply the subject content more effectively outside of the classroom, receive more frequent and immediate feedback, and provide students an opportunity to think about, talk about, and process course material.

This receptor forms a cytoplasmic complex with Hsp90, p23, and XAP2. We have previously reported that down-regulation of p23 triggers degradation of the AHR protein, uncovering a potentially dynamic event which controls the cellular AHR levels without ligand treatment. Here we investigate the underlying mechanisms for this p23 effect using wild-type HeLa and the p23 knockdown HeLa cells. Reduction of the Hsp90 and XAP2 contents, however, did not affect the AHR protein levels, implying that this p23 effect on AHR is more than just alteration of the cytoplasmic complex dynamics. Association of p23 with Hsp90 is not important for the modulation of the AHR levels since exogenous expression of p23 mutants with modest Hsp90-binding affinity effectively restored the AHR message and protein levels. The protein folding property of p23 which resides at the terminal 50-amino acid region is not involved for this p23 effect. Results from our interaction study using the affinity purified thioredoxin fusion proteins and GST fusion proteins and isothermal titration calorimetry showed that p23 directly interacts with AHR and the interaction surface lies within AHR amino acid 1–216 and p23 amino acid 1–110. Down-regulation of the p23 protein content promotes the ubiquitination of AHR, indicating that p23 protects AHR from the ubiquitin-meditated protein degradation.

The use of eye-catching color patterns to warn predators of an unprofitable trait is referred to as aposematism. Once predators learn to recognize the color pattern, a new signaling niche becomes available where other species can share the same signal. This mimicry niche can involve a “hide in plain sight” strategy by mimicking or parasitizing this signal, with mimics lacking the defense and associated costs that make them unprofitable. This is termed Batesian mimicry, and it decreases predation by taking advantage of the memory and learning of the predator community. Thus, a primary prediction in Batesian mimicry systems is that the model and mimic are found in sympatry. Another, fundamental prediction of Batesian mimicry is that the model outnumbers the mimic and that models emerge before the mimics to educate the predator guild. Some of these patterns were not significant in the California Coast Ranges as seen in Long et al., (2015), and no study has estimated population sizes for this temperate Batesian mimicry system. Furthermore, compared with community studies of mutualistic Müllerian mimicry in the tropics, no studies have tested predictions of parasitic Batesian mimicry on small scale patterns of habitat use and movement patterns. If mimicry is as an important part of the biology of these temperate species, as it is for their tropical counterparts, we predict that in addition to emerging first and being more abundant, the model and mimic will overlap strongly in habitat but the model will be more abundant in each habitat, and will move more and be more widespread among available habitats.

The filamentous cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme can transiently differentiate motile filaments, called hormogonia, in response to various changes in the environment.  Hormogonia utilize a Type IV pilus (T4P) complex in conjunction with a secreted polysaccharide for gliding motility along solid surfaces.  This study identified three genes, designated hmpU, hmpW, and hmpV, encoding the protein components of a PSRS involved in regulation of hormogonium motility in N. punctiforme.  Although mutant strains with in-frame deletions in hmpU, hmpW, and hmpV differentiated morphologically distinct hormogonium-like filaments, further phenotypic analysis demonstrated significant distinctions among the strains.  The ∆hmpW strain contained a higher percentage of motile filaments that moved faster than the wild-type strain, while the ∆hmpU and ∆hmpV strains consisted of fewer motile filaments that moved at a slower rate compared to wild type.  Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence of PilA, the major component of the pilus in the T4P system, showed that although all mutant strains appeared to express similar levels of PilA protein, the ∆hmpU and ∆hmpV strains displayed reduced extracellular PilA.  Lectin blotting and staining with fluorescently-labeled UEA lectin demonstrated a decrease in extracellular hormogonium polysaccharide in the ∆hmpU and ∆hmpV strains, consistent with the current understanding that the polysaccharide is secreted via the T4P system.  Epistasis analysis demonstrated that the ∆hmpW, ∆hmpV double-deletion mutant strain displayed reduced spreading in plate motility assays, similar to the ∆hmpV single mutant.  Together, these results support a model in which the HmpU phosphatase and HmpW serine kinase control the phosphorylation state of the HmpV protein, modulating its activity on a downstream target to ultimately promote activation of the T4P motor complex and enhance hormogonium motility.",Biological Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4134&context=uop_etds,2018,-23.462439,-14.394804,Evidence that a partner-switching regulatory system modulates hormogonium motility in the filamentous cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme,"Riley, K."

This is especially true among the species rich Nymphalidae, the brush-footed butterflies. Species in the genus Adelpha are known to be “the most trying taxonomically of all nymphalids” DeVries (1987), and as such are fruitful ground for uncovering unknown diversity. About half of the species within Adelpha have undescribed life histories, while A. serpa stands out within the genus in having remarkably wide host breadth, and thus potentially harbors cryptic diversity. Here we describe the life histories of two species of Adelpha from Costa Rica, and use an integrative approach to clarify species level boundaries within the Adelpha serpa-group. We conclude that A. serpa does not show significant evidence of harboring cryptic species, and appears to be a geographically widespread species and a hostplant generalist.

The length of telomeres is shortened during cell replications, and its length limits the replication capacity of cells. Telomerase is over-expressed in 85–90% of cancer cells, responsible for extending the telomere length in cancer cells. Guanine-rich DNA sequence can self-assemble into unique G-quadruplex structures that interfere with the extension of telomeres by telomerase. Therefore, DNA G-quadruplex has recently received much attention because of its important regulatory functions in telomerase-mediated cancerization. The formation of G-quadruplex requires monovalent cations (Na+ and K+) or small molecules known as G-quadruplex ligands. In the present work, we developed a serial of G-quadruplex ligands by tethering side-chains to two core structures: 1,10-phenanthroline (Phen) and thiazole orange (TO). Biophysical studies including DNA thermal denaturation monitored by fluorescence orcircular dichroism, fluorometric titration, and ESI-MS spectrometry reveal that the binding of the synthesized ligands to G-quadruplex is side-chain dependent. The arylsulfanyl side chains significantly improve the binding affinity and selectivity of 1,10-phenanthroline towards G-quadruplex over duplex DNA. The polyamine side chains are a suitable structural motif for remarkable G-quadruplex binding affinity based on the results from both Phen and TO derivatives. These ligands greatly inhibit the telomerase activity in vitro, determined by a modified telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay. Amongst these promising telomerase inhibitors, a thiazole orange derivative containing a side chain of spermine shows an outstanding telomerase inhibition effect at nanomolar concentrations, which is comparable to the most effective synthetic telomerase inhibitors, BRACO-19.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4166&context=uop_etds,2018,-23.559185,-14.393448,Development of Novel Phenanthroline and Thiazole Orange Derived G-quadruplex Ligands and Telomerase Inhibitors,"Wang, S."

The interviews were conducted individually with six high school teachers from public schools, of which four were special education teachers and two were general education teachers. These interviews revealed that teachers defined professional space as personal identity and felt that the loss of their professional space emotionally impacted them. The interviews further revealed the lack of acceptance of the program by the teachers, who felt that administrative support was insufficient. Also, the findings revealed that the special education teachers felt marginalized and disrespected by the students in the co-taught classroom. This was largely because of the visual impact of the small space allocated to them in the co-taught general education classroom; while the general education teachers felt inconvenienced and pressurized into making space for the SPED teachers.

It focused on four identities: race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and nationality.  The goal of the study was to determine how Trinidadian immigrants define and reconceptualize these four dimensions of their identities as they make new lives in American society.  Another goal was to determine whether identities shift and, if so, how, for Trinidadian immigrants when they move across cultures to a society where they are no longer in the racial, ethnic, or cultural majority.  Using a mixed-methods approach, the research included an initial online survey followed by qualitative interviews with a few selected participants.  Survey results showed that for three of the identities (ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and nationality), more than half of respondents indicated no change in saliency.  Survey respondents rated their shift in racial identity as almost equal between more salient and no change in saliency upon moving to the United States.  However, qualitative findings showed that, of the four identities, race became most salient in the United States, even for those who showed no shift in this identity after resettling here.  The racial identity of interviewees was influenced by three main factors: the racial identity they were ascribed in the United States, their experiences with racial discrimination, and being made to feel “othered” in a society that does not recognize their Trinidadian racial and ethnic categories.  Findings also showed that immigrants in this study who are ascribed a Black identity in the United States acculturate to both African American and European American cultures in multicultural Philadelphia, while maintaining a strong connection to their Trinidadian national identity.

In recent years, the educational climate has prioritized academic achievement and standardized testing, thus diminishing the role of content areas such as physical education (Sallis, Mckenzie, Beets, Beighle, Erwin, & Lee, 2013). Classroom teachers are now more likely to assume the responsibility for providing physical education programming (Erwin, Beighle, Morgan, & Noland, 2011). Therefore, it is important to better understand the educational beliefs classroom teachers possess and investigate their personal experience within the physical education environment. To identify the beliefs of classroom teachers, this study used convenience, snowball, and purposive sampling techniques which were employed to secure voluntary participants. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data. When all data was collected the researcher then transcribed, open-coded, analyzed, and synthesized the data. During the data analysis process the researcher looked to discover common themes between the participants’ teaching experiences and beliefs towards physical education by using an inductive analysis approach. The results emerged with themes related to mandating physical education, previous physical education knowledge, personal experience in physical education and acquiring appreciation for physical education.

With more than 50 farmers markets and between 7,000 – 8,000 acres of “boutique farms” in the region, the Mayor stated the designation would be more than “simply a marketing campaign.”  Based on interviews with a wide variety of people working in “local food” (including a non-profit organization with a mission to get kids to eat their vegetables, large corporations, and small businesses) this thesis will explore the concept of local food in Sacramento, the Farm-to-Fork movement and what it has meant for the region.  With an annual festival that has seen increased attendance in each of its five years, from an estimated 50,000 people the first year, to 75,000 people in 2016, the designation branded Sacramento as a food destination city bringing visitors and their dollars as intended.

Due to inefficient vasculature, cancer cells experience hypoxia, glucose deprivation and low pH even during the early stages of tumor growth. Tumor cells are proposed to adapt to these microenvironmental conditions by acquiring increased migratory and invasion potential and tumor initiating ability. Our research addresses the effect of these biochemical factors of the tumor microenvironment (TME) on motility, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NCI-H292 and NCI-H1650 NSCLC cell lines were used to measure the effect of the above mentioned TME conditions. Apart from acidic pH, low glucose and hypoxia, the effect of high glucose conditions was also measured on H292 and H1650 cell lines. Acidic pH, high and low glucose conditions were observed to have no effect on the motility, EMT and stemness of H1650 cell line. Hence, use of this cell line was discontinued and no further treatment conditions were tested on this cell line. In H292 cell line, acidic pH, low glucose and tumor like conditions combined together (acidic pH + low glucose + hypoxia) [AP+LG+HYP] significantly decreased motility whereas hypoxia significantly increased the motility of H292 cells. High glucose did not affect the motility of H292 cells. Although N-cadherin, a mesenchymal marker, expression was significantly upregulated by acidic pH, high and low glucose conditions, no direct correlation was observed between N-cadherin expression and motility. E-cadherin expression was not affected by acidic pH, high and low glucose conditions. An increase in N-cadherin expression and no change in E-cadherin expression under these conditions might be an indication of partial EMT. Hypoxia and AP+LG+HYP did not alter the expression of E-cadherin and N-cadherin. Although expression of vimentin, another mesenchymal marker, and Sox2, a cancer stem cell marker (CSC), was observed at the mRNA level, no expression of vimentin and Sox2 proteins was observed in H292 cells under any of these treatment conditions. The expression of OCT4, another CSC marker, was also not observed at the protein level in H292 cells. HIF-1α expression was observed in H292 cells under normoxic conditions and was unaffected by hypoxia and AP+LG+HYP. Therefore our research indicates that the effect of these TME conditions might be different on different cancer cell lines or cancer types. Not all cancers may depend on EMT for metastasis.

The purpose of this study was to examine the differences in metacognitive development between AVID and non-AVID students in two high schools during their 9 th grade year. Metacognition was operationally defined as an individual’s thinking about how they are thinking, called ownership of learning, and the application of skills, called learning techniques, that students utilize to accomplish a task. Additionally, GPAs were compared to determine potential differences in cognitive development. The quantitative study used a pre-test, post-test design, utilizing a validated test called the LASSI-HS™, which measures a student’s level of metacognition. An Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was used to determine whether there were differences on eight metacognitive measures of attitude, motivation, anxiety, time management, self-testing, study aids, test strategies, and collaboration. A Chi-square test for independence was used to examine differences between taking at least one advanced course during 10 th grade for both AVID and non-AVID students. Lastly, a two sample t-test was used to examine potential differences between 9 th grade GPAs between AVID and non-AVID students. The framework was based on Flavell’s theory of “Metacognition and Cognitive Monitoring” and Conley’s Key Learning Skills and Techniques. The findings of this study indicate that there was a significant difference between AVID and non-AVID students in the use of study aids and advanced coursework in the 10 th grade.

This study addresses this shortcoming by examining the use of economic metaphors in contentious argument, while paying attention to how metaphor's linguistic variability derives from the rhetorical nature of discourse, and how the context of conflicting ideologies facilitates clashes between larger political metaphors. After establishing the ubiquity of metaphor in economic policy discourse, this study elaborates on an understanding of a fractured political discourse with an historical model that traces this fracture back to four dominant ideological positions. Finally, rhetorical criticism grounds the research by refining a conceptual theory of metaphor into a methodology that directs attention to more elaborate analogies and extra-discursive narrative elements. The chosen artifact for this study is Bill Clinton’s 2012 Democratic National Convention speech, due to its relevance in contemporary American political and economic discourse. Clinton’s address defended Obama’s incumbent appeal for a second term as U.S. president by concentrating on the aftermath of the 2008 economic crisis as a case study about the philosophical differences between the Democratic and Republican Parties. Clinton constructs a narrative of the American economy by using individualistic progress metaphors that animate a cooperation-conflict dichotomy of Democratic and Republican opposition.

The mechanical properties of spider silk out-perform the mechanical properties of many man-made materials we use today, including tensile steel, KevlarTM, and nylon.  To further understand the proteins the silks are made of and how they are synthesized in the silk glands, transcriptional and proteomic analysis was conducted.  Transcriptional regulation of silk genes was investigated to determine how and why several silk proteins are transcribed into mRNA products together in the same gland.  The tubuliform gland is one of the major contributors of egg case silk production.  The mRNA of major ampullate spidroins 1 and 2 (MaSp1, MaSp2) and tubuliform spidroin 1 (TuSp1) is found in the tubuliform glands, but not all are translated into proteins for egg case silk purposes.  To understand why not all of the transcribed mRNA products are not being translated into proteins, the promoter sequences of MaSp1, MaSp2, and TuSp1 were aligned and found to contain an E-Box site.  Several constructs containing the cDNA of the promoter sequences and cDNA of bHLH transcription factors were built to test transcriptional regulation of MaSp1, MaSp2, and TuSp1.  Proteomic analysis of egg case silk and the tubuliform glands was also conducted to identify further proteins synthesized in the tubuliform glands and to determine which of these proteins are ultimately incorporated into the egg case silk fibers by MS/MS analysis.

Monardella linoides, M. purpurea, and M. sheltonii populations are distributed in the overlapping boundaries of these two species (M. odoratissima and M. villosa) and considered within the complex as well. Previous studies and floral manuals have found that the vegetative plant parts from these five Monardella species intergrade with the other taxa in the complex throughout their distribution in California and in the western United States. Many of these vegetative characters are used to differentiate the five species from one another. Furthermore, floral characters have not been studied as a  tool for delimiting species in this genus. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses (ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Principal Components Analysis, Discriminant Analysis, Mantel Tests, and Cluster Analysis) of measurements of nine vegetative and 21 floral characters were used to gain a more accurate idea of relatedness between these five species of Monardella and help strengthen the argument for reclassification of the species’ taxonomic identities. Based on analysis of single characters among the five Monardella species, discontinuities among the taxa were not observed. The multivariate analyses performed in this study were unable to fully segregate Monardella species from one another and did not suggest clearly defined taxa. Overlap and intermingling between all species was seen in all analyses. This study was unable to define consistent floral combinations for detecting and delimiting taxa. In floral morphology, flower length characters were found to be weakly correlated with flower width characters.

First, the historical context of Westerners coming to Japan is discussed. Next, literature from the field of intercultural studies is considered. This literature is used to provide a framework for analyzing Western sojourners’ acculturation experiences in Japan, as well as for choosing the research methods for conducting a qualitative analysis. The research involved interviewing 12 expatriates from English-speaking countries who have been in Japan for at least 10 years. Their acculturation experiences were analyzed, with a particular focus on finding hidden barriers to acculturation. The study concludes that numerous barriers to acculturation do exist. Commonly observable barriers included lack of employment security for some sojourners, and a poor fit between an individual’s personality and the host culture. These issues are applicable to anyone adapting to life in a different culture. However, this research also exposed a number of hidden barriers arguably unique to the Western sojourner’s acculturation experience in Japan. These barriers include the challenge of developing satisfying relationships with Japanese, due primarily to different expectations for psychological closeness and self-disclosure in Japan and the West. Another is the social effect of Othering, the centuries-old process where Japanese society divides things into those which are Japanese and those which are not, and the consequent empathy deficit that Japanese experience toward outsiders. The thesis concludes by offering recommendations for how long-term Western residents in Japan can improve their adaptation and acculturation experience. These include the obvious advantages of learning the Japanese language, and the less obvious benefits of learning and practicing mindful intercultural communication.",Other,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1233&context=uop_etds,2017,14.136436,10.542755,Long-Term Western Residents in Japan Hidden Barriers to Acculturation,"Heath, D."

Culex tarsalis is found in rural as well as some residential areas in the Western United States, so they are under insecticide pressure from both agricultural spraying and vector control. In response to insecticide pressure, mosquitoes can evolve two primary resistance mechanisms: target site insensitivity, as a result of DNA mutation, and elevated levels of detoxifying enzymes (GST, alpha and beta esterases, and P450 oxidases).  The two types of target site insensitivity studied here in Cx. tarsalis are kdr, which is a mutation in the para-type voltage gated sodium channel and ace-1, which is a mutation in acetylcholinesterase gene.  This study focused on a population of Cx. tarsalis in Sutter County, where insecticide use shifted from sumithrin to Naled over the course of the summer.  The goal of this study was to determine if there was resistance to insecticides and characterize the mechanisms of resistance.  Mosquitoes were separated into resistance levels based on CDC bottle bioassay results using Naled, sumithrin, and permethrin insecticides.  Mosquitoes were used to test for elevated levels of detoxifying enzymes and genetic qPCR testing for either kdr and ace-1 mutations.  Bottle bioassay results suggest Cx. tarsalis populations from Sutter County are mostly resistant to pyrethroids while not being resistant to organophosphates.  Enzymatic assays suggest high concentrations or activities of detoxifying enzymes are commonly seen in resistant individuals, occasionally elevated levels of multiple enzymes within an individual.

An online survey was completed by 140 full-time kindergarten teachers in Yangpu District, Shanghai, who reported their demographic information, perceived burnout levels as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory—Educators Survey (MBI-ES)(Maslach, Jackson &Schwab, 1996), and personality factors measured by the NEO Five Factor Inventory (Costa & McCrae, 1989). The demographic variables that were found to be correlated with the burnout level of kindergarten teachers in Shanghaiwere age, teaching experience and educational background. The results of this study indicated that teachers with more years of teaching experience were more likely to experience higher levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. Compared with older teachers in kindergarten, younger teachers in Shanghai were found to be more at risk for emotional exhaustion. This study also provided strong evidence to support that those teachers who have a bachelor degree or above tended to feel more accomplished in their work. Marital status and the type of school were not related to burnout of kindergarten teachers in Shanghai. As for personality factors, there was an association between the NEO Five Factor Inventory scales of neuroticism, agreeableness,and openness and the MBI-ES burnout dimensions.Kindergarten teachers in Shanghai who scored higher in neuroticism reported feeling more emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and feeling less personal accomplishment. Kindergarten teachers in Shanghai who scored higher score in agreeableness reported feeling less emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. Kindergarten teachers in Shanghai who scored higher in openness to experience reported feeling less depersonalization and more personal accomplishment. The identification of individual types that are more susceptible to burnout hopefully would render practical values to both the employees and the administrators in Shanghai kindergartens.For those who have the intention of working as kindergarten teachers, knowing the possible correlations between individual traits and job burnout could tell them whether they might experience burnout if they choose this profession and whether such a decision is reasonable for their personality.

Cardiac amyloidosis, which is most commonly, caused by aggregation of Immunoglobulin (Ig) light chains or transthyretin (TTR) in the cardiac muscle, represent an important and often underdiagnosed cause of heart failure. TTR-mediated amyloid cardiomyopathies are chronic and progressive conditions that lead to arrhythmias, biventricular heart failure, and death. As no Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs are currently available for treatment of these diseases, the development of therapeutic agents that prevent TTR-mediated cardiotoxicity is desired. AG10 is a potent and selective kinetic stabilizer of TTR. AG10 prevents dissociation of TTR in serum samples obtained from patients with amyloid cardiomyopathy. The oral bioavailability and selectivity of AG10, makes it a very promising candidate to treat TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy. Understanding the reason behind the potency of AG10 would be beneficial for designing stabilizers for other amyloid diseases. This would be possible by designing and synthesizing structural analogues of AG10.

Lacking many of the defenses present in other organisms to combat oxidative stress, Trichomonas vaginalis relies extensively on the thioredoxin system—NADPH, thioredoxin reductase, and thioredoxin—as a means to protect against exposure to excess oxygen.  Current trichomoniasis treatment relies exclusively on the 5-nitroimidazole drugs, but fear of drug-resistant strains and allergic reactions to 5-nitroimidazole treatment necessitate the discovery of a new treatment method for trichomoniasis.  Previous research has shown that auranofin, an FDA-approved drug, was effective at inhibiting activity of one of Trichomonas vaginalis’ isoforms of thioredoxin reductase (of which the organism has five total).  Our research showed that only two of the isoforms were transcribed and expressed at high levels, and that both of these isoforms were susceptible to auranofin treatment.  Not only that, these two isoforms were also shown to be susceptible to various auranofin analogs, having comparable or lower IC50 values.  Further tests on these analogs might show that they are actually better treatment candidates if they exhibit less symptoms than auranofin.  Experiments examining how mRNA and protein levels were modulated in response to two different concentrations of auranofin treatment showed that while some isoforms show increased levels, no one isoform experienced any drastic changes.

Endemic in the eastern United States, cases have become more prevalent over the last few decades. While prevalence in California is generally low, Lake and San Joaquin Counties have reported rates comparable to the East Coast at 3.73% and 0.71%(CAPC 2017), respectively. Aedes sierrensis is thought to be responsible for transmission in California, but in some cases, it exists in inadequate quantities and temporal ranges to explain parasite activity. Based on Huang et al. (2013) and Tran (2016), bloodfeeding patterns, and other vector criteria, Culex pipiens complex and Culiseta incidens were chosen to evaluate for vector competence. Female field-caught mosquitoes were reared, infected (2.5-5 mff/μl), and decapitated at 15, 18, or 21 days post infection (dpi).  Cs. incidens was reluctant to feed using an artificial feeding system and will require additional trials.  On the contrary, trials on Ae. sierrensis and Cx. pipiens complex were both completed successfully. Both species were determined to be competent vectors of D. immitis.  Based on our findings, more than half of Ae. sierrensis females produced emerging L3s by 21 dpi, while Cx. pipiens complex never produced L3s in more than 5% of females.  In conjunction with other factors such as the detection of D. immitis in wild mosquitoes, host-seeking preferences for domestic dogs, and appropriate temporal overlap, this suggests that both Ae. sierrensis and Cx. pipiens complex may play central roles in Lake or San Joaquin Counties, CA when abundant.

No treatments have been developed that effectively destroy cancer cells while also keeping healthy cells safe.  In this work, the knob-socket construct is used to analyze two systems involved in cancer pathways, the PDZ domain and the Bcl-BH3 complex.  Application of the knob-socket model in mapping the packing surface topology (PST) allows a direct analysis of the residue groups important for peptide specificity and affinity in both of these systems.  PDZ domains are regulatory proteins that bind the C-terminus of peptides involved in the signaling pathway of cancer progression.  The domain includes five -strands, two -helices, and six coils/turns.  In this study, the PST of all eight solved crystal structures of T-cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 (Tiam1) PDZ domains are mapped to reveal details of ligand-domain binding pockets and packing interactions.  Four main interactions were identified in the comparison of the PST maps and a consensus sequence was calculated using knob-socket interaction data.  In the case of the Bcl-BH3 complex, binding of these two proteins prevents an unhealthy cell from undergoing apoptosis.  In the knob-socket mapped protein-ligand interactions, the helical ligand consists of 8 to 10 residues that specifically interact with four helices on the binding protein: the N-terminus of Helix2, the main bodies of Helix3 and Helix4 and the C-terminus of Helix5.   Among all of the interactions that were analyzed, there were three amino acids from the ligand, glycine, leucine, and isoleucine, that always packed into the hydrophobic groove that is key for ligand recognition.  By using knob-socket analysis to map quaternary packing structure, it was possible to identify the quaternary-level protein interactions that define ligand specificity and binding strength.  From this analysis, possible protein mimetics can be developed that could be used as cancer treatments.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3983&context=uop_etds,2017,-23.980497,-14.384791,The Rational Investigation of Anti-Cancer Peptide Specificity using the Knob-Socket Model,"Patel, S."

The role of AhR in carcinogenesis is an area of concern due its altered levels in various tumors. AhR binds structurally diverse ligands and may elicit different responses upon ligand binding. The crystal structure of mouse AhR PAS-A domain was already obtained due to the robustness of mouse AhR in comparison to human. There is a possibility of overexpressing mouse AhR ligand binding domain in its soluble and functional form, which could be used to perform ligand binding studies. This forms the aim of this thesis. Mouse AhR ligand binding domain was constructed as mAhR aa211-384, which was purified under native conditions with the use of 6 histidine tag but soluble overexpression was not possible. Thus a solubility enhancing tag called maltose binding protein (MBP) was used for purification of mAhR aa211-384 under native conditions, which still did not yield soluble overexpression. The strategy was modified to solubilize the protein by denaturation with the use of 8M Urea, which solubilized the protein but included an issue of protein binding to column. Subsequent use of an even stronger denaturant, 6M guanidine hydrochloride, solubilized most of the protein and purified mAhR aa211-384 in huge amount. Successful refolding of mAhR aa211-384 with the help of MBP was made possible by gradual reduction of denaturant in the presence of arginine, but 6 histidine tag failed to refold the protein. The refolded protein was tested for its secondary structure by circular dichroism. Thus, mAhR aa211-384 was solubilized and purified under denaturing conditions with the help of both 6 histidine and MBP, however efficient refolding of mAhR aa211-384 was only possible with the help of MBP but not 6 histidine. The MBP-refolded mAhR aa211-384 stayed in solution even after the removal of 0.1 M arginine, thus confirming the effectiveness of MBP in protein refolding in comparison to 6 histidine tag.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1259&context=uop_etds,2017,-22.885485,-10.401635,Soluble and Functional Overexpression of the Ligand Binding Domain of Mouse Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor in <i>E.Coli<i>,"Ponnakanti, H."

An online survey was completed by 816 preschool teachers in Shanghai who responded to items regarding their demographic characteristics, self-efficacy towards inclusion, perception of school climate and attitude towards inclusion. Bandura (1995)’s theory of self-efficacy provides the theoretical framework. Results of the study indicate that: 1) regular preschool teachers in Shanghai are young and well-educated, 2) regular preschool teachers in Shanghai exhibit high self-efficacy levels towards inclusion, 3) attitudes of regular preschool teachers towards inclusion in Shanghai are generally positive but mixed with concerns, 4) regular preschool teachers’ perceptions of school climate in Shanghai are positive which indicates favorable environmental conditions to implement inclusion, 5) higher self-efficacy levels among preschool teachers in Shanghai are related with more positive teachers’ attitudes towards inclusion and 6) more positive teachers’ perceptions of school climate are associated with more positive teachers’ attitudes towards inclusion. The association between teacher self-efficacy and attitude towards inclusion was not found to be moderated by school climate. However, school climate was found to not only have a direct effect, but also an indirect effect on attitude towards inclusion through teacher self-efficacy (the mediating variable). The Chinese government and education administration are encouraged to enact policies and practices that promote the creation of positive school climate and enhance teachers’ self-efficacy levels as this correlational study suggests that both school climate and teacher self-efficacy may impact teacher attitude. Improved attitudes may then lead preschool teachers to utilize inclusive practices potentially benefiting students in Chinese early childhood education settings.

AhR is a ligand sensitive transcription factor. The unbound AhR resides in cytoplasm as a complex containing p23, Hsp90 and XAP2. Upon ligand binding, AhR undergoes conformational change and translocates into the nucleus. Once the AhR dimerizes with AhR nuclear translocator (Arnt), the chaperone proteins in the complex get dissociated followed by the activation of transcription of various genes such as CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 by AhR-ARNT heterodimer. Various cancers have altered levels of AhR in the absence of ligand. Our current knowledge is only limited in the regulation of AhR protein levels in its ligand bound state. However, the mechanism involved in the regulation of AhR protein levels in the absence of ligand is still unknown. To make the study of AhR signaling pathway possible, our lab has been working on the expression of various AhR constructs in E.coli using recombinant DNA technology. As AhR forms inclusion bodies due to its poor solubility in the cytoplasm of the host bacteria, it is tagged as a “difficult to express” protein. Therefore, it is challenging to generate functional recombinant AhR protein. My thesis documents the expression of human AhR construct amino acid 108-400 using two different solubility enhancing tags (thioredoxin and maltose binding protein).

Diamond coated cutting tools are ideal for machining this type of pMMC. Previous research studies focus on the machinability of pMMCs with low ceramic content. The aim of this research is to determine the optimal cutting parameters for machining AlSiC material containing high silicon carbide particle reinforcement (>25%). The optimal cutting parameters are determined by investigating the relationship between cutting forces, tool wear, burr formation, surface roughness, and material removal rate (MRR). Experimental milling tests are conducted using CVD diamond coated end mills and non-diamond tungsten carbide end mills. It was found that low tool rotation speeds, feed rates and depths of cut are necessary to achieve smoother surface finishes of R a < 1 μm. A high MRR to low tool wear and surface roughness ratio was obtainable at a tool rotation speed of 6500 r/min, feed rate of 762 mm/min and depth of cut of 3 mm. Results showed that a smooth surface roughness of the workpiece material was achieved with non-diamond tungsten carbide end mills, however, this was at the expense of extreme tool wear and high burr formation.

This study aimed to develop a better understanding of kindergarten teachers’ beliefs and practice of Developmentally Appropriate Practice (DAP) in Shanghai in the context of educational reform, the relationship between teachers’ beliefs and their practice, and whether the type of school (public versus private) moderates the belief-practice relationship. Applying a correlational research design, this study measured kindergarten teachers’ beliefs and practices by the instrument of Teacher Beliefs and Practices Survey (three to five-year-olds) (Chinese version, by Wang, Elicker, McMullen, & Mao, 2008). Respondents from both public ( n = 111) and private ( n = 71) kindergartens in Shanghai completed this survey. Findings suggested that teachers endorsed both appropriate and inappropriate beliefs and engaged in both appropriate and inappropriate practices (as defined by DAP principles), but with significantly higher levels of endorsement in appropriate (as compared to inappropriate) beliefs and engagement in appropriate (as compared to inappropriate) practices. Teachers’ beliefs and practices were reported to be moderately positively correlated, implying that their practices tend to reflect their beliefs. School type was not found to moderate the belief-practice relationship; however, public and private school teachers, on average, differed in their levels of endorsing appropriate and inappropriate beliefs, and the levels at which they engage in appropriate practices (but not inappropriate practices, with the Bonferroni adjustment applied to control the Type I error rate).

I conducted an exploratory qualitative research study using focus groups with 13 ethnocultural community leaders in Edmonton, Alberta. The main goals were to understand from their lived experiences and perspectives how intercultural dialogue could contribute to meaningful and culturally appropriate civic engagement for ethnocultural communities. The findings indicated that ethnocultural community leaders are passionate about and committed to improving the lives of their communities, identify strongly with Canada and Edmonton as their home, and appreciate being meaningfully involved in civic affairs. The findings indicated that intercultural dialogue is meaningful if it takes place in a larger framework of civic engagement practices. This framework of meaningful practices is presented along with recommendations that can be adapted and implemented by municipalities, institutions, and organizations that wish to engage meaningfully with and respond effectively to diverse ethnocultural communities.",Other,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1235&context=uop_etds,2016,15.352155,12.677953,Intercultural dialogue for civic engagement Perspectives from the multicultural community,"Ball, C."

The peptides characterized were acetylated polyalanine di-, tri-, and tetra- peptides containing a proton-accepting probe: lysine and or the non-proteinogenic lysine-homologs: ornithine, 2,4-diaminobutyric acid, and 2,3-diaminopropionic acid. Peptides were studied in isomeric pairs for which the basic amino acid was placed closest to the N-terminus or the C-terminus of each peptide family (A n Probe vs. ProbeA n ). Using a variety of mass spectrometry based techniques and infrared multiphoton dissociation ion spectroscopy, the isomeric families of polyalanine peptides were characterized. Quantum chemical techniques were employed in parallel to provide theoretical predictions of three-dimensional structure, physical properties (dipole moment, polarizability, and accessible surface area), thermochemical values, and vibrational IR spectra, to gain further understanding of the peptides studied and to push the limits of current theoretical models. Overall it was found that the AnProbe peptide was more basic than their ProbeAn isomer. For the dipeptide systems, the greater basicity of AProbe peptides was due to efficiently charge-solvated ions which formed more compact structures compared to their ProbeA counterpart. For the tri- and tetra- peptide systems, greater basicity of the A 2,3 Probe peptides was likely due to formation of α or 3 10 helix-like structures in the protonated forms., introducing the macrodipolar effect, which cooperatively encouraged helical formation while stabilizing the charged site. On the other hand, ProbeA 2,3 peptides formed charge-solvated coils which do not exhibit any kind of dipole effect, resulting in lower basicity than their A2,3Probe counterpart.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1126&context=uop_etds,2016,-16.436941,-8.014041,"Thermochemical differences in lysine and lysine-homolog containing oligopeptides Determination of basicity and gas-phase structure through mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, and computational chemistry","Batoon, P."

Bettencourt,"Health sciences, Physiology, Biological sciences, Health and environmental sciences, Collegiate soccer, Heart rate recovery, Overtraining, Training distress","Introduction: College soccer begins in August and ends in November, allowing athletes less than 4 months to condition and play all regular season matches. A consistent consequence of this condensed season structure is an elevated risk of training distress. In turn, training distress can lead to impaired performance and an increased likelihood of injury. Thus, it is important to identify signs of symptoms of distress early so that appropriate adjustments to training volume can be made. Simple, noninvasive techniques, which can be implemented by coaching staff, are ideal. This study investigated whether heart rate recovery was effective as an indicator of training distress in collegiate soccer players. Methods: 26 women and 17 men were enrolled in the study. Data were collected at 4 time points, measuring shuttle run time, heart rate recovery time, resting heart rate values, and MTDS questionnaire score. Heart rate recovery time was defined as the duration it took an athlete to reach 60% heart rate maximum from peak heart rate following the shuttle run. Results: Shuttle run times were prolonged in the beginning and end of season compared to the two mid-season tests (p < 0.001); heart rate recovery times differed at each time period (p=0.003); freshmen deviation from baseline was greater compared to all other grades (p=0.001). Although not statistically significant, resting heart rate values trended up at the end of the season for both genders. Conclusions: Heart rate recovery did not detect training distress in athletes; shuttle run times and resting heart rate appeared to be possible variables that should be taken in to consideration for further research and possibly assist in tailoring training session for optimal performance.",Health and Sport Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1302&context=uop_etds,2016,-5.3567195,-2.6183193,Does heart rate recovery detect training distress in collegiate soccer players?,"Bettencourt, H."

Though there are numerous references in the literature regarding the learning styles of students there are also references to the inaccuracy of such studies. Part of the problem is in the definition of what construes a particular learning style and how to match the outcomes of one study based on one set of criteria with another study based on a dissimilar set of guide lines. This study focuses on learning preferences that make up just a part of a learning style. To gather information two quantitative surveys were utilized that involved three class years of dental students attending the University of the Pacific Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry. Both surveys were designed to be voluntary and anonymous assuming that the results would be fewer but more accurate. The first survey (VARK Survey), based on the principles of the modes represented by VARK (Visual, Aural, Read-write, and Kinesthetic), gathered information regarding how dental students prefer to take in and give out information when learning is the goal. The second survey (Survey II) gathered information validating the results of the first survey along with information regarding how dental students prefer to be assessed. One hundred forty five students responded to the VARK Survey and one hundred students responded to the Survey II. Results of the VARK Survey indicated that dental students rely heavily on using a combination of modes, a category termed “multimodal.” Responses to singular VARK modes resulted in Kinesthetic followed by Read/write, Aural, and Visual. The preferred methods of assessment in descending order were: Multiple-Choice, Combination of Methods, Essay, Oral Exam, Fill-in-the-Blanks, and True/False. The majority of dental education is presenting information and assessing the results of the teaching. Teaching and assessing strategies should be formulated to achieve optimal results when educating students is the goal.

Butelo,"Educational psychology, Education, Friendship quality, Future outlook, Identity, Peer influence","Students experience many developmental changes as they experience adolescence. They begin to examine their identities in relation to others and often question their original values and beliefs that have been guiding their behavior. In fact, this susceptibility to peer influence can lead adolescents to engage in risky behavior rather than consider the future consequences of their actions. Despite the large body of literature that delineates peer influence and its effect on adolescent behavior, researchers have yet to examine the impact of high quality friendships on adolescents’ ability to resist to peer influence, and the following effects that this resistance to peer influence has on the youth’s identity and future consideration. Friendship quality was chosen as a moderating variable in the present study, as resistance to peer influence’s effect on identity and future outlook is believed to depend on whether or not the adolescent is in a high quality friendship. Specifically, the present study aims to answer the following research question: Does friendship quality moderate the effect of resistance to peer influence on identity and future outlook in adolescents after controlling for gender, socioeconomic status, and parental involvement in schooling? Many theories support the hypothesis that resistance to peer influence is associated with identity and future consideration, such as Social Comparison Theory, as well as theories associated with motivation.

Although the effects of antecedent and consequent manipulations on recycling are fairly well understood, with few exceptions (e.g., Trudel & Argo, 2013), the effect of stimulus characteristics on recycling has not been evaluated. Using a between subjects experimental group design, Trudel and Argo (2013) found size, and for cans, condition, affected recycling, such that more participants recycled large pieces of paper and large undented aluminum cans and fewer participants recycled small pieces of paper and small dented and undented aluminum cans. However, Trudel and Argo’s (2013) data provide little information regarding how context or group sessions affect recycling or whether the condition of paper might differentially affect recycling, as it did with cans. The present study used individual sessions, controlled for contextual variables (i.e., participant viewed all sizes of paper), and examined the effect of both size and condition of paper (i.e., crumpled or smooth) on recycling. Participants ( N = 60) were told this was a study about memory. They were instructed to complete a set of sorting tasks twice (for a total of two trials) with four different pieces of paper (standard-size smooth, standard-size crumpled, half-size, eighth-size), and, after each sorting task, to dispose of a piece until all four pieces were disposed. Results indicated neither size nor condition affected recycling; nearly all participants (90%) recycled all the paper.

It is understood that sexual selection, or competition for mates, drives sexual dimorphism, but more recently it has been suggested that resource partitioning, or niche pressure, may exert evolutionary pressure, leading to sexual dimorphism. Many members of the sarseilloid family of ostracods exhibit sexual dimorphism of their lateral eyes with males having an image forming eye, while females have a rudimentary eye limited to sensing light and dark. Ostracods progress through five instar stages of development before becoming an adult, and by studying expression levels of selected developmental genes at instar IV, V adult stages and embryos, the underlying expression pattern change that leads to phenotypic differences can be seen. By comparing the differences in expression between two sarseilloid species, Euphilomedes carcharodonta and Euphilomedes morini , we can see how these species develop their specific phenotypes. In E. carcharodonta and E. morini , the genes Sine oculis, Dachshund, Seven in absentia, Chaoptic, Protein Kinase C and Opsin show different expression patterns between groups. The highest expression levels of Sine oculis are in developing embryos when compared to other stages of development. Dachshund, Seven in absentia, Chaoptic, Protein Kinase C and Opsin show significantly different patterns in males or noticeable male trends, demonstrating that these genes are important in the development and function of the sexually dimorphic lateral eye.

P. pastoris has the ability to produce foreign proteins at high levels extracellularly, and since it secretes few endogenous proteins, this ability eliminates the need for expensive purification costs. It also combines the ease of genetic manipulation with rapid growth to high cell densities and provides complex posttranslational modifications. The most commonly utilized secretion signal leader in P. pastoris is the MATα prepro signal leader, originally found in S. cerevisiae. However, because some proteins cannot be secreted efficiently by P. pastoris, strategies to enhance secretion efficiency have involved the modification of the MATα prepro secretion signal leader. The study focuses on using site-directed mutagenesis of specific sets of amino acids of MATα prepro secretion leader to evaluate the correlation between secondary structure and secretion level. MATα pro-HRP mutants were created, in order to analyze the export of heterologous proteins in P. pastoris. In addition, structural analysis through circular dichroism was performed on mutant MATα pro-peptides to evaluate differences in secondary structure as a result of the mutagenesis. Mutants, pSC6 (Δ57-65) and pSC7 (Δ66-70) did not generate the same HRP secretion level as Δ57-70. In addition, a new proposed model of MATα pro-peptide signal leader was created. This new model suggests that the N and C terminus of MATα pro-peptide need to be presented correctly for proper interaction with secretion machinery and for efficient protein secretion.

Mosquitoes, in particular, are notorious vectors of potentially deadly diseases like malaria, dengue fever, and West Nile virus. Anopheles gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus are just two examples of mosquito vectors that possess genetic mutations (denoted kdr and ace-1 ) and/or enhanced detoxifying enzymes (oxidases, esterases, and glutathione-s-transferases) that confer insecticide resistance. Culex tarsalis, a primary vector for West Nile virus among other arboviruses in Northern California, is a target for insecticide application and is under constant insecticide pressure, making it likely to adapt resistance mechanisms like kdr or ace-1 or increased detoxifying enzymes. Culex tarsalis adult females were collected from Yolo and Sutter counties. A bottle bioassay was completed to determine prevalence of resistance to Sumithrin (a pyrethroid; N=217) and Naled (an organophosphate; N=154). A susceptible lab-reared colony was used for comparison. Microplate assays were completed to investigate elevated levels of detoxification enzymes present as well as AChE. PCR was used to amplify the VGSC and ace-1 genes. Amplicons were sequenced and aligned to determine if mutations were present. No evidence of the ace-1 mutation was found in any mosquitoes, but the kdr mutation was seen in all semi-resistant and resistant individuals exposed to Sumithrin. Microplate data revealed significant differences between certain detoxifying enzymes within mosquitoes collected from Sutter and Yolo Counties exposed to both Sumithrin and Naled. The data obtained from this study suggests that resistance to Sumithrin in both populations is carried out by both metabolic and target site insensitivity, while resistance to Naled is caused by metabolic resistance only.",Biological Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1166&context=uop_etds,2016,-14.4990425,-13.367054,Detection And Characterization of Insecticide Resistance Mechanisms in Culex Tarsalis,"Choi, E."

However, the field of creativity studies has only recently come to recognize improvisation as a site for the creative process. While the jazz performance tradition has traditionally operated with a more collaborative and community-based pedagogical model based on various playing opportunities such as apprenticeships and participation at local jam sessions, the growth of jazz courses and degree programs has raised questions on the efficacy of current teaching practices within academia. The following central research question guided this study: What is the relationship between jazz improvisation and creativity? A qualitative methodology served as a theoretical underpinning for framing two supportive research questions: (1) What pedagogical beliefs do jazz educators hold in how they conceptualize improvisation as a creative process? (2) What are the pedagogical practices utilized by jazz educators in teaching improvisation as a creative process? This study utilized Moustakas’ transcendental, phenomenological research design and defined the phenomenon as the process of teaching jazz improvisation. Seven expert jazz educators situated in a variety of teaching contexts throughout Northern California were selected as participants using purposeful, snowball sampling strategies. Twenty themes emerged and were organized through four features of improvised music found across a variety of genres: creative, spontaneous, social, and accessible. These findings challenge de-socialized ways of teaching and learning creativity and add to the knowledge base on the teaching beliefs and practices of jazz educators within the fields of creativity, jazz, and music education. In providing valid data through semi-structured interviews, observations of the participants in a teaching context, and documents such as syllabi, student handouts, and music recordings, this study is intended to inform jazz educators and academics of the importance of collaborative, fully-immersed learning opportunities for the development of the skills needed for jazz improvisation.",Education,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&context=uop_etds,2016,16.979006,11.034808,A Phenomenological Inquiry into the Process of Teaching Jazz Improvisation,"Coss, R."

Cruz-Khalili,"Behavioral psychology, Behavioral Sciences, Psychology, Psychology, Expectancy effects, Infant preference, Parent bias, Side stability","Several researchers posit the tendency of adults and children to behave positively towards individuals similar to themselves (in-group bias) and to behave hostilely towards those dissimilar to themselves (out-group bias) is not learned, but is instead innate. Using infant-parent dyads, Mahajan and Wynn (2012) examined this question by asking infants ( n = 32), seated in their parents' lap, to choose between two foods, watch a puppet show during which two puppets verbally stated a liking or disliking of these foods, and then choose one of the puppets. They found more infants chose the puppet that “liked” the same food the infants chose. Based on these results, Mahajan and Wynn suggest this tendency is innate. However, methodological limitations including the unintentional effects of parent bias and use of a single choice-trial make this conclusion premature. The purpose of the current study was to replicate and extend the methodology of Mahajan and Wynn by addressing these limitations. Twenty-four infant-parent dyads were separated into two groups. After choosing a food and watching the puppet show, infants in Group 1 (multiple-baseline across participants design) chose a puppet 3-5 times before their parents were exposed to the parent bias measure and then chose an additional five times; parents in Group 2 (between-subjects comparison group) were exposed to the parent bias measure first, then infants chose a puppet five times. In Group 1, 7 of 12 infants (58%) selected the similar puppet on the first choice trial. In Group 2, 2 of 12 infants (17%) selected the similar puppet on the first choice trial. Repeated choice trials showed no influence of parent bias but did show patterns of side stability with 18 of 24 infants making a majority of their puppet selections on the same side.",Educational and School Psychology,,2016,-2.03713,-16.89241,Factors affecting infants' choices An examination of infant choice stability and parent expectancy effects,"Cruz-Khalili, A."

Previous studies of this group and the closely related Palearctic genus Argynnis , suggest that Speyeria is monophyletic but derived from within Argynnis . Sampling in these studies has either involved few basal Speyeria species, or too few Argynnis species (Simonsen 2006, Simonsen et al. 2006). Thus, no comprehensive phylogenetic analysis exists for all members that answers the question of monophyly of Speyeria , or other subgeneric taxa,and their relationship to Argynnis species. A phylogenetic analysis was completed of all North American Speyeria species and nearly all species within Argynnis , using one mitochondrial (CO1) and four nuclear genes (EF1?, WG, GAPDH, and RPS5). The results indicate that North American Speyeria is a monophyletic group, but that Palearctic Argynnis is paraphyletic. Three major lineages are identified within Argynnis sensu lato : two Palearctic and one containing both Palearctic and Nearctic species. Argynnis species representing the subgenera Argyreus , Argyronome , Childrena , Damora , Pandoriana , and Nephargynnis , belong to a well-supported lineage that split early in the evolution of the group and is comprised of species with long branches. Fabriciana and Mesoacidalia were both recovered as strongly supported lineages, except for A. clara which was recovered as sister to Speyeria . In summary, the phylogenetic analyses suggest the need for reorganization into three genera: Argynnis , Fabriciana , and Speyeria . The results have implications for the conservation of these butterflies across the temperate zone by providing a framework for understanding potential gene flow between sympatric species complexes, proper taxonomic validity, and the natural history of threatened populations of Speyeria and Argynnis butterflies.",Biological Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1167&context=uop_etds,2016,-3.7737856,-18.867302,Molecular Phylogenetic Analysis of Argynnis Fabricius (1807) including North American Speyeria Scudder (1872),"Moya, R."

During the PS condition, participants performed the power snatch exercise at increasing intensities (40% 1 repetition max [RM], 60% 1RM, and 80% 1RM) after a dynamic warm up. Vertical jump performance was measured prior to the warm up, and after each power snatch exercise in the PS condition. During the CON condition, vertical jump performance was measured at the same times, with the participants substituting the power snatch exercise for a seated position. The results showed no significance ( p > 0.05) in vertical jump performance during each condition, with a trend being seen during the gradual increase in intensities.

In vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) and physiological based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) models are two major PK prediction strategies. However, both IVIVE and PBPK models are considered as immature methodologies due to their poor predictability. The goal of the research is to investigate the discrepancies within IVIVE and PBPK predictions according to first-principles: convection, diffusion, metabolism, and carrier-mediated transport. In Chapter 2, non-permeability limited hepatic elimination under perfusion steady state is examined. The well-stirred model is re-derived from the convection-dispersion-elimination equation when both dispersion and concentration gradient are ignored and re-named as the zero-gradient model. Pang and Rowland’s lidocaine data are re-analyzed. Their data analysis was based on an unfair comparison of the zero-gradient and parallel- tube models at two different efficiency number ranges. The interference of sensitivity greatly biased the comparison. I also show that both theoretical discussions and experimental results indicate that apparent intrinsic clearance and intrinsic clearance could be affected by blood flow and protein binding. In Chapter 3, I discuss permeability limited hepatic elimination under perfusion steady state. Permeability limited elimination is classified to diffusion dominated, carrier-mediated transport mediated, and mixed effects based on drug passage mechanisms. Each of these three drug passage classes is sub-divided to sink condition and finite volume condition based on the boundary conditions of drug passage. In Chapter 4, the discrepancies within IVIVE for both non-permeability limited and permeability limited drugs are explored. The deficiencies in assay design and data analysis of common in vitro metabolism assays are investigated. The scaling/converting equations for both non-permeability limited and permeability limited drugs are derived. In Chapter 5, I focus on transient PK models. Numerical analysis using finite difference and finite volume methods are introduced into the derivation and discussion of transient PBPK models.

Diethyl Ether (Et2O) and Acetic Anhydride (AcOAc) were chosen because of their and their fragments' relevance to combustion chemistry. The Imaging PEPICO (iPEPICO) experiment at the VUV beamline of the Swiss Light Source (SLS) was utilized to provide dissociative ionization data of the two molecules of interest. In this experiment, the unimolecular fragmentation pathways of energy selected ions can be studied with high energy resolution. The iPEPICO experimental setup also allows the measurement of the dissociation rates, which is indispensable to derive accurate thermochemical information on large ions. The experimental data on the fragmentation of ions of interest are then examined through modeling the experimental ion fractional abundances (breakdown curves, BDCs) and reaction rates, in a modeling framework based on the RRKM statistical theory. In our first project, diethyl ether was studied to provide the appearance energies of its daughter ions along with the dissociation pathways of the molecular ion, leading to thermochemical data (such as heats of formation) pertinent to combustion chemistry. A revised ionization energy (IE) differing from the reviewed National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) was also proposed. In the second project presented, AcOAc was also measured on the iPEPICO apparatus to understand its dissociative photoionization processes. The appearance of trace amounts of acetone in the ionization spectra, discrepancies in the statistical models of the branching ratios, and the quantum chemical calculations all point to the existence of a post-transition-state bifurcation, when a single TS separates multiple products, namely a methyl-loss fragment and acetone, as well.

The forces that drive protein structures to form compact folds are largely dominated by burial of hydrophobic amino acids, which results in non-specific packing of amino acid side-chains. The knob-socket model attempts to organize side-chain packing into tetrahedral packing motifs. This tetrahedral motif is characterized with a three residues on the same secondary structure forming the base of the tetrahedron packing with a side-chain from a separate secondary structure. The base of the motif is termed the socket, and the other side-chain is called the knob. Here, we focus on extending the knob-socket model to understand tertiary and quaternary structure. First, single knobs sometimes pack into more than one socket in real structures. We focus on understanding the topology and amino acid preferences of these tertiary packing surfaces. The main results from the study of tertiary packing surfaces is that they have a preferred handedness, some interactions are ancillary to the packing interaction, there are specific amino preferences for specific positions in packing surfaces, and there is no relationship between side-chain rotamer of the knob packing into the tertiary packing surface. Next, we examine the application of the knob-socket to irregular and mixed packing in protein structure. The main conclusions from these efforts show canonical packing modes between secondary structures and highlight the important of coil secondary structure in providing many of the knobs for packing. Third, we investigate protein quaternary structure with a clique analysis of side-chain interactions. We identify a possible pseudo knob-socket interaction, and compare knob-socket interactions between tertiary and quaternary structure. Lastly, we discuss the workflow used in CASP12 to predict side-chain contacts and atomic coordinates of proteins.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1263&context=uop_etds,2016,-16.802279,-8.546496,Explorations into protein structure with the knob-socket model,"Fraga, K."

Recess in school settings can provide opportunities for children to try and meet these guidelines. However, research suggests that recess alone does not increase physical activity levels. To combat this problem, antecedent manipulations (e.g., manipulating the physical environment or introducing planned activities) are commonly implemented as an intervention to increase physical activity. These interventions, however, do not provide salient consequences for physical activity to ensure the likelihood that these behaviors will occur again in the future. A more promising approach might be to develop interventions that assess the use of group contingencies in an effort to increase physical activity during recess time. The purpose of the current study was to implement the Step it UP! game (a modified version of the good behavior game) in three different classrooms during their recess periods and to evaluate the effect of group contingencies on physical activity levels in elementary school-aged children. The Step it UP! game was compared to traditional recess periods (i.e., without the game) in an alternating treatment design.

Gase,"Alternative Energy, Applied sciences, Below-rated, Blade, Rated, Swept-blade, Swept-blades, Turbines, Variable speed, Wind","Modelling studies have shown that 1.5 and 3.0 MW wind turbines with blade sweep have an increased annual energy production (AEP) of approximately 5% when compared to straight-blade wind turbines. The objective of the research was to further increase below-rated, variable speed, power capture when using swept-blades. When operating in the variable speed region, the turbine’s torque is proportional to the square of the generator speed, and k is the proportionality constant (T = kΩ 2 ). Initial studies indicated that the value of k needed to be lowered from the original value to increase AEP. This proved to be slightly beneficial for the 3.0 MW turbine but not for the 1.5 MW turbine. The optimal tip speed ratio was too high for both turbines and limited the ability to increase AEP. Original swept-blade chords were designed to fit a linear pattern for manufacturing purposes, but it is believed this is no longer a necessary constraint. The blades were redesigned to have a non-linear chord distribution, which is based on the Betz optimal design method, and the resultant increase in solidity proved to be the solution for slowing down the blades’ rotational speed. The change in chord design proved to be beneficial for both 1.5 and 3.0 MW wind turbines and had immediate, measurable increases to AEP. An effort to further increase AEP was then conducted by using an alternative torque-speed controller, which used a different equation to relate speed and torque. This method only resulted in an increase of AEP for the 1.5 MW turbine. In conclusion, the highest recorded AEP increases from straight-blade values were 6.9% and 8.9% for the 1.5 and 3.0 MW turbines, respectively. The 1.5 MW turbine benefited from the custom controller and redesigned chords, whereas the 3.0 MW turbine only benefited from redesigned chords.",Engineering,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1224&context=uop_etds,2016,-8.689888,0.98937774,Below-Rated Control of Swept-Blade Wind Turbines,"Gase, Z."

Gender stereotypes continue to constrain male and female access and experiences in sport (Endendijk et al., 2013; Daltry, 2012). Given that competitiveness lies at the very heart of the definition of sport, athletes are often asked to act competitively to achieve success. However, behaviors marked as competitive can often contradict the societal norms of femininity resulting in sporting females frequently receiving conflicting messages on how to act. Research indicates that gender stereotypes are well established by the age of 8, however young adolescence is a complex time of change and growth in the performance of gender especially within a sport context (Perry & Pauletti, 2011; Steinfeldt, Zakrajsek, Carter, & Steinfeldt, 2011).

Alcohol education courses have been proposed as one strategy to reduce this problem, with an emphasis on teaching college students to accurately track their drinks. Many of these courses are taught in a small group format, and aim to teach students to accurately identify and pour standard servings, largely because students report using the counting of drinks as a protective strategy against high-risk drinking.

With nearly 10% of strains resistant to metronidazole, new treatments to combat this parasite have become a necessity. FDA-approved drug screens have identified the compound, auranofin, as an effective agent against similar protozoans. The mechanism of inhibition by auranofin has been found to proceed through inhibition of the thioredoxin-based anti-oxidant pathway, targeting the enzyme thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). In this study, auranofin was found to be an effective inhibitor of T. vaginalis TrxR activity. Auranofin was also found to be an effective inhibitor of several trichomonad strains in culture, exhibiting IC50 values comparable to metronidazole. These studies indicate that auranofin is a promising agent for treatment of trichomoniasis. Another aspect of T. vaginalis biology addressed in this study is the ability of T. vaginalis to carry out homologous recombination (HR), a process used to repair double-stranded breaks in DNA. The protein radiation sensitive protein 51 (Rad51) plays a crucial role in the process of HR in mitotic and meiotic recombination. In this study, experiments were carried out to elucidate the role of T. vaginalis Rad51 in homologous recombination. TvRad51 was found to exhibit nuclear localization and was capable of carrying out ATP hydrolysis. Rad51 was shown to be up-regulated at the protein level in T. vaginalis in response to treatment with DNA-damaging agents.

As private giving becomes increasingly essential to ensuring access to quality public higher education, the need exists to better understand women’s philanthropic patterns, motivations, and behavior so that practitioners of higher education fundraising can apply the knowledge tools that will facilitate more effective strategies when cultivating, soliciting, and stewarding major donors. This qualitative study explored an existing conceptual framework with the intent to substantiate its application with women who were major donors to public higher education. The framework, coined by its authors (Shaw & Taylor, 1995; Shaw-Hardy, 2005; Shaw-Hardy & Taylor, 2010) as the Six Cs Plus 3 of Women’s Giving, consists of nine themes, each starting with the letter C, that embody the motivations and outcomes of women philanthropists. Using collective case study methodology and cross-case synthesis as an analytic technique, a composite of six women was presented and reported as a representative case to protect the confidentiality of the study’s participants. The representative case displayed evidence of support for five of the nine C s in the women’s philanthropy framework (create, connect, celebrate, control, and confidence). Across the cases, minimal or no support surfaced for four of the Cs (change, commit, collaborate, and courage). Based on the data collection criteria relating to geographical parameters, the study introduced an additional C, context, as a motivation to donate. From these findings, suggestions on the application of the women’s philanthropy framework in relation to donor giving levels is proposed. Moreover, the study’s conclusions underscore the call for continued scholarship in the area of women and philanthropy, particularly as it relates to women making significant financial contributions.",Education,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1039&context=uop_etds,2016,13.503328,10.96554,Women and Philanthropy in Higher Education A Collective Case Study of Major Donors,"Tunnell, M."

The children (aged 5 to 6) were pretested to evaluate their knowledge of general and targeted words using a researcher-designed instrument tailored to the content of three selected English stories. Validity evidence based on contrasted groups and test-retest reliability had been previously gathered for the 24-word instrument (based on 8 words per story) in a pilot study. The children in the concurrent translation group listened to the English storybook with the reader using both English and Chinese interchangeably to assist children in understanding the story. With the children in the preview-review group, the reader built background knowledge and discussed difficult vocabulary in Chinese before reading the storybook only in English then reinforcing key points in Chinese after reading the storybook. Each of three English stories was read three times by the researcher/reader separately to both groups. Two days after the third reading of each story, children were post-tested on the 8 words associated with that specific story. Total posttest scores, based on combining the three 8-word posttest scores, were compared to the 24-word pretest scores to examine vocabulary gains. Results suggest that both methods of reading English storybooks to Chinese preschoolers were effective. Results also indicate that children in the concurrent translation group performed significantly better than children in the preview-review group, even after initial levels of vocabulary, based on the pretest, were controlled (Cohen’s ƒ 2 = .42, which is considered to be a large effect).

Macgregor,"Gerontology, Music, Social psychology, Social sciences, Communication and the arts, Psychology, Caregiving, Communication, Dementia, Familial, Music therapy","Caregivers of persons with dementia often struggle to sustain meaningful communication and reciprocal emotional connection due to the deterioration in functional memory and the resulting diminishment of social-interactive abilities in their loved one. The very personhood of the care recipient is also often compromised by the reduction in those socio-communicative capacities, which in turn, can impact the function of the caregiving relationship. Emotional, as well as social isolation can increase for the familial caregiver just as it often does for the care recipient. This thesis examines the impact that an individualized, home-based music therapy program had on the emotional connection and reciprocal interactions of four familial caregiving dyads. Data were collected over a month-long period using qualitative research methods including pre and post interview, a caregiver's journal log, researcher's journal log, participation, direct observation, and the observations of the caregiver respondents themselves as they engaged in the therapeutic process with their familial care recipient. Through a cross-case analysis of data collected, four main themes emerged to reflect the experiences of the participants. These were: 1) a longing for reciprocity, 2) the experience of emotional reciprocity, 3) the emergence of personhood through shared musical experiences, and 4) perseverance in the pursuit of meaningful communication.

Mai,"Pharmacy sciences, Health education, Health and environmental sciences, Education, Health outcomes, Medicare, Medication therapy management","Background: The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and other non-physician health care providers (dentists, optometrists, etc.) has steadily increased in the United States; however, the associated outcomes reported in the Medicare beneficiary population are limited. Objective: To evaluate the utilization of different healthcare providers by Medicare beneficiaries and assess resultant beneficiary outcomes. Methods: Fourteen outreach events targeting Medicare beneficiaries were conducted throughout Northern/Central California during the 2014 open enrollment period. Trained student pharmacists (working under licensed pharmacist supervision) provided beneficiaries with comprehensive medication therapy management (MTM) services. During each intervention, demographic, quality-of-life, health behavior and health provider/service utilization data were collected. Results: Of 620 respondents, 525 (84%) and 84 (14%) reported using at least one non-physician healthcare professional or CAM provider, respectively. Beneficiaries who reported using non-physician healthcare providers were significantly (p < 0.05) more likely to indicate being ‘very confident’ in managing their chronic health conditions. The number of providers seen with prescriptive authority was positively correlated with the number of prescription medications taken (r s =0.342, p < 0.001). The total number of providers seen was positively correlated with the number of drug-related issues identified (r s = 0.179, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Many beneficiaries have multiple chronic conditions and increasingly utilize a variety of healthcare professionals. As such, bridging the communication chasm between these professionals can improve humanistic outcomes and minimize medication related issues of Medicare beneficiaries.

The proline-rich AKT substrate of 40-kDa (PRAS40), also known as AKT substrate 1 (AKT1S1), lies at the crossroads of these cascades and inhibits the activity of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase. Firstly, our findings showed that disruption of PRAS40, a substrate of AKT and component of mTORC1, alters glucose homeostasis and prevent hyperglycemia in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes mouse model. PRAS40 ablation resulted in a mild lowering of blood glucose levels and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), a lowered insulin requirement, and improved glucose tolerance in untreated PRAS40 gene knockout (PRAS40 (-/-)) as compared to wild-type (PRAS40 (+/+)) mice. PRAS40 deletion significantly attenuates hyperglycemia in STZ-induced PRAS40 (-/-) mice through increased hepatic AKT and mTORC1 signaling, a lowered serum insulin requirement, and altered hepatic GLUT4 levels. Furthermore, we investigated the role of PRAS40 in possible feedback mechanisms, and altered AKT/PRAS40/mTOR signaling in the pathogenesis of tumor progression. For this we probed new datasets extracted from Oncomine, a cancer microarray database containing datasets derived from patient samples, to further understand the role of PRAS40 (AKT1S1). These data strongly supports the previous findings that PRAS40 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for various cancers. Elevated levels of HER2 and PRAS40 are found in some human breast cancers. To directly test the importance of these genetic events in mammary tumorigenesis, we assessed whether disruption of PRAS40 could alter mammary tumor occurrence in HER2 overexpressing mice. HER2 overexpressing mice expressing the activated rat Erbb2 (c-neu) oncogene under the direction of the MMTV promoter was bred with Cre-recombined homozygous (PRAS40-/-) mice. We examined mammary tumor development in the presence (PRAS40+/+) or absence (PRAS40-/-) of PRAS40 using this double transgenic mouse mammary tumor model. Loss of PRAS40 resulted in a delayed mammary tumor onset, improved tumor-free survival, and reduced mammary pre-cancerous lesions in PRAS40-/- versus PRAS40+/+ HER2 overexpressing mice. These results suggest that PRAS40 knockdown could be an attractive target and adjuvant therapy in HER2-positive breast cancers.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1128&context=uop_etds,2016,-18.17741,-12.801074,Role of PRAS40 in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) modulation in cancer and insulin resistance,"Malla, R."

However, there is a marked scarcity in research examining the relationship between family communication patterns and online interaction. Data collected from a group-administered survey of 246 undergraduate students was used to examine eleven hypotheses related to family communication patterns, self-esteem, social media use, and online/offline family interaction. Family communication patterns were labeled as either high conversation-orientation or high conformity-orientation. Existing research suggests that these communication patterns are inversely related and a correlation analysis in this study supports this notion. The results indicate that there is a positive correlation between high conversation-orientation families and both online and offline family interaction as well as measures of self-esteem.

A recent study suggested that parents have difficulty implementing time out in the home when they are supposed to (Jensen et al., 2016). The present study aimed to determine if there were difficulties in stimulus or setting generalization. Six parent participants completed pre and post training in-home naturalistic video observations, as well as a generalization probe role-play test following training. Results showed that parent’s accuracy and parent’s ability to implement when they should were two different skills. Parents scored high for accuracy of steps correct in both the post training in-home observations and the generalization probe role-plays. However, parent’s correct attempts out of the possible opportunities were only moderate in the post training generalization probes and poor in both the pre and post training in-home observations. How to implement time out was the only skill directly taught to parents and not when to implement time out. The authors suggest that knowing when to implement time out may be a generalization deficit and a recognition of opportunities in the home deficit. This version of time out training may benefit from additional training to foster generalization. Future research may benefit from systematically analyzing whether parents can recognize opportunities for time out in the home through other parent in-home videos and if they can, more emphasis on generalization of a skill to the parent’s home would be necessary in training.",Educational and School Psychology,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3963&context=uop_etds,2016,15.688745,-3.3054533,Behavioral Parent Training Time Out Technique and Parent’s Ability to Generalize the Implementation to other Untrained Situations,"Mitchell, A."

Proteins exert higher specificity and more complicated functions; they are well endured and less inclined to evoke immune responses when compared to small molecule drugs. However, exogenous proteins when administered intravenously are prone to immune reactions. Chemical and enzymatic denaturation, and poor penetration into cells are some other challenges for clinical use of intracellular proteins. Proteins that enter cells through endocytosis will be eventually degraded in lysosomes if they do not escape the endosomal pathway before reaching lysosomes. Therefore, the development of protein delivery systems, including liposomal and/or polymeric nanoparticles would substantially facilitate the clinical use of proteins. This approach can protect the proteins from denaturation and immune reactions. Previously, our group has developed cationic lipid-coated magnesium phosphate nanoparticle (CAT-LP MgP NP) formulations to enhance the intracellular delivery of the protein, catalase. The objective of the current research is to improve the physicochemical properties of CAT-LP MgP NP. The magnesium phosphate (MgP) nanoparticles were prepared by water-in-oil micro emulsion precipitation. The cargo protein catalase was complexed with cationic liposome prepared by lipid hydration and extrusion. Then magnesium phosphate (MgP) nanoparticles were mixed with the catalase-complexed cationic liposome to form the final complexed CAT-LP MgP NP formulation. By sonication, extrusion and modification of the lipid composition, we have successfully prepared complexed CAT-LP MgP NP formulations of reduced size. The pH-sensitivity of the improved delivery system was observed at pH 6.0. Furthermore, the improved delivery system reduced the Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) level inside EA.hy.926 cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) to 35% of the control, whereas the previously reported catalase formulation of our group reduced the ROS levels to 50%, indicating that the complexed formulation delivers functional catalase more efficiently into the EA.hy.926 cells.

During these intercultural encounters, conflicts often arise. Intercessors are needed to help people navigate these types of disagreements. Mediators are considered some of these peacekeepers. This thesis engaged with mediators at a mediation center in the Midwestern United States in order to understand what strategies seemed most effective. I examined the research that scholars have conducted regarding building rapport through utilizing respect and face issues, as well as nonverbal behavior. In addition, I explored the connection between the understanding of these factors and intercultural competence and intercultural conflict competence. The purpose of this thesis was to see how these mediators understood and valued respect and face issues, including nonverbal behavior, when building rapport with parties in mediations. These mediators were engaged in two manners, via survey and interview questions. The intercultural competence of the mediators in these domains was also explored. The results of the research in this thesis showed how the mediators were skilled in some areas, such as in rapport building and respect issues. It further revealed that they were in need of some skills for their toolbox, such as training on face issues and nonverbal behavior, including silence, tone of voice, and eye contact. Detailed recommendations for the mediators are provided. Future research is encouraged: A group of mediators that have exhibited intercultural competence should be selected in order to test their intercultural conflict competence.",Other,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1240&context=uop_etds,2016,16.676704,-1.5139635,Building rapport in mediation A study of the application of intercultural competencies in a Midwestern mediation center,"Newton, E."

Whistleblowers and human rights activists oftentimes need to communicate in secret to avoid persecution by the powerful organization monitoring their communications. Current anonymity systems often depend on the public internet, and as such are subject to some degree of interference. Cloak is a textual communication network created to hide the existence of the network itself from an outside observer, such as a repressive government or corrupt corporation. Cloak does not use the public internet, and as such would evade the majority of the monitoring in place today. Cloak also does not use any special infrastructure or create its own infrastructure, minimizing the risk of infrastructure attacks. Finally, Cloak provides plausible deniability for its users should they be investigated. Cloak works by hiding its messages inside of normal phone activity. Two Cloak nodes can identify each other by looking at wifi probe messages that are generated by phones in the vicinity of an open wifi hotspot. They can then connect to the hotspot and browse like normal, while hiding messages inside their browsing. Because this is open wifi, the other nodes can see the hidden messages and store them, and carry them closer to their destination. Cloak can hide its messages in a lot of ways. It can first send images with messages embedded in them. It can also use places where a website asks for data in a opaque format, such as YouTube video ids. Finally, if encrypted browsing is available, a Cloak node can just send the encrypted message and act like something went wrong with its encrypted browsing.",Engineering,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1215&context=uop_etds,2016,-8.198485,-5.7048044,Creation of a covert communications network for evasion of surveillance,"Nish, R."

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has crucial roles in safeguarding the correct folding and assembling of proteins through the use of ER molecular chaperones. Homeostasis disruption of the ER leads to activation of the Unfolded Protein Response. The UPR is a three-arm pathway that plays a role in regulating ER stress and ultimately leads to cell survival or cell death if the cell fails to recover. There are three major proteins for sensing Endoplasmic Reticulum stress: RNA dependent protein kinase RNA like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and inositol-requiring ER-to-nucleus signal kinase 1 (IRE1). PERK activation leads to the phosphorylation of the α-subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF2α on Serine 51 in activating its function. EIF2α phosphorylation leads to up-regulation of GADD34 and GADD34 bind protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to dephosphorylate eIF2α and brings the cell back into homeostasis. CReP, similar to GADD34, binds to PP1, to dephosphorylate eIF2α. The RVxF motif, RARA sequence, and amino acids throughout the GADD34 sequence play a role in PP1 binding and are essential for dephosphorylating eIF2α in cells. The first 180 amino acids of GADD34 play a role in subcellular localization whereas the first 300 amino acids of CReP play a role for localization to the ER. Early on in the UPR the levels of binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), CHOP, GADD34, and CReP increase; however, the mRNA levels of CReP drop during the 24-HR Thapsigargin treated stage. Two primary proteins that bind CReP were COPS5 and SNAPIN.

Previous research has focused on children with autism, behavior problems, and interventions, whereas this study did not include autism as a characteristic of the sample population. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine if early services moderated the relationship between maternal education and problem behaviors in children; for which each regression model utilized maternal anxiety, child’s gender, and expressive and receptive language ability as the control variables. When investigating the moderating influence of early services for children with low IQ in the relationship between behavior problems and maternal education, it was found that early services did not have a significant moderating effect. However, it was found that maternal education explained a significant amount of variance in the externalizing behavior of children at the .05 level. This finding indicates that the level of maternal education is a better predictor of behavior problems than whether a child receives early intervention.

Penchala,"Pharmacology, Biochemistry, Pharmacy sciences, Pure sciences, Health and environmental sciences, Chemical synthesis, Drug delivery, Peptides, Pharmacokinetics","The misassembly of soluble proteins into toxic aggregates, including amyloid fibrils, underlies a large number of human degenerative diseases. Cardiac amyloidoses, which are most commonly caused by aggregation of Immunoglobulin (Ig) light chains or transthyretin (TTR) in the cardiac interstitium and conducting system, represent an important and often underdiagnosed cause of heart failure. Two types of TTR-associated amyloid cardiomyopathies are clinically important. The Val122Ile (V122I) mutation, which alters the kinetic stability of TTR and affects 3% to 4% of African Americans, can lead to development of familial amyloid cardiomyopathy. In addition, aggregation of WT TTR in individuals older than age 65 years causes senile systemic amyloidosis. TTR-mediated amyloid cardiomyopathies are chronic and progressive conditions that lead to arrhythmias, biventricular heart failure, and death. As no Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs are currently available for treatment of these diseases, the development of therapeutic agents that prevent TTR-mediated cardiotoxicity is desired. Here, we report the characterization of AG10 , a potent and selective kinetic stabilizer of TTR. AG10 prevents dissociation of V122I-TTR in serum samples obtained from patients with familial amyloid cardiomyopathy. In contrast to other TTR stabilizers currently in clinical trials, AG10 stabilizes V122I- and WT-TTR equally well and also exceeds their efficacy to stabilize WT and mutant TTR in whole serum. Crystallographic studies of AG10 bound to V122I-TTR give valuable insights into how AG10 achieves such effective kinetic stabilization of TTR, which will also aid in designing better TTR stabilizers. The oral bioavailability of AG10 , combined with additional desirable drug-like features, makes it a very promising candidate to treat TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy. The second part of the thesis discusses harnessing TTR as a platform to enhance in vivo half-life of therapeutic peptides. The tremendous therapeutic potential of peptides has not yet been realized, mainly owing to their short in vivo half-life. Although conjugation to macromolecules has been a mainstay approach for enhancing protein half-life, the steric hindrance of macromolecules often harms the binding of peptides to target receptors, compromising the in vivo efficacy. Here we report a new strategy for enhancing the in vivo half-life of a model peptide Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) and its analog GnRH-A without compromising their potency. Apart from GnRH, we have used other peptides to study their proteolytic stability in vitro . Our approach involves endowing peptides with a small molecule that binds reversibly to the serum protein transthyretin. Although there are a few molecules that bind albumin reversibly, we are unaware of designed small molecules that reversibly bind other serum proteins and are used for half-life extension in vivo . We show here that our strategy was effective in enhancing the half-life of an agonist for GnRH receptor while maintaining its binding affinity, which was translated into superior in vivo efficacy.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1129&context=uop_etds,2016,-21.574066,-6.4043,"Characterization of AG10, a potent stabilizer of transthyretin, and its application in enhancing in vivo half-life of therapeutic peptides","Penchala, S."

The co-teaching model of student teaching, in which cooperating teachers and student teachers jointly plan and deliver instruction, has been adopted by university-based teacher education programs across the United States. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between elements of the co-teaching model of student teaching and teacher efficacy outcomes for student teachers. Research suggests that teacher efficacy, a teacher’s beliefs in his or her capacity to affect student performance, is positively associated with teachers’ behaviors and commitment to teaching as well as student achievement and motivation. This quantitative study utilized multiple regression statistical analyses to examine the relationship between co-teaching overall and the relationship, communication, classroom applications, and knowledge base elements and teacher efficacy overall and the domains of efficacy in student engagement, efficacy in instructional strategies and efficacy in classroom management. Descriptive statistics indicated that the relationship and communication elements of student teaching were more prevalent than the classroom applications and knowledge base elements. Student teachers in the sample reported higher levels of efficacy in instructional strategies than efficacy in classroom management and efficacy in student engagement. A positive and statistically significant relationship between teacher efficacy overall, efficacy in student engagement, efficacy in instructional strategies, and efficacy in classroom management and the co-teaching model of student teaching, after controlling for gender and credential program, was found.

Research indicates that Hispanic males lag behind other underrepresented populations when it comes to college readiness, application, and enrollment rates. Given that parent education level is a strong predictor of degree attainment and that Hispanics have some of the lowest parent education levels, it is essential to examine how first-generation college-bound Hispanic males experience supports that help mitigate the barriers they face when pursuing college enrollment. Particularly in California, where the Hispanic population continues to rise exponentially, it is important for educational practitioners to develop a better understanding of how to support first-generation Hispanic students. This study aims to contribute to the research on improving college access for underrepresented populations using resiliency theory as the lens through which to examine this issue. Rather than look through a deficit-oriented lens, resiliency theory focuses on the protective factors or supports that help mitigate risk factors or barriers. Using data collected through interviews and document analysis, the findings here showed the significant role of supports such as academic capital and college knowledge, a systematic focus on college readiness, college readiness and bridge programs, and a strong counseling program for these students. In addition, it was evident that the students’ familial connections to college had a significant impact on the level of academic capital of each of them, reinforcing the need to look beyond the label of “first-generation”.",Education,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1041&context=uop_etds,2016,5.6351523,3.9666364,Factors Influencing College Readiness Supports and Barriers Experienced by Academically Resilient First-Generation Hispanic Males,"Peterman, A."

For an increasingly large percentage of such veterans, the decision that they will make will be to become full-time college students and pursue an education that will provide them with meaningful careers. Unfortunately, due to the type of constant deployment cycles that many student-veterans undergo while enlisted/commissioned, a large percentage of veterans taking part in the military-to-college transition process have received mental/physical injuries that serve as major obstacles for achieving successful transitions. Specifically, this study seeks to determine if social support, willingness towards campus communication, self-esteem, and eagerness towards social networking site usage are related to a student-veterans overall level of academic engagement. This study draws its data from a sample of 202 full-time student-veterans. Data was collected through a volunteer self-administered online questionnaire. Six sections respectively measured eagerness towards SNS (Social Networking Site) usage, academic engagement, social support, willingness towards campus communication, self-esteem, and demographic information. Data was collected from California community colleges, California State Universities institutions, University of California institutions, and California private non-for profit institutions. This study found a statistically significant positive relationship between social support, self-esteem, willingness to communicate, and academic engagement. Essentially, student-veterans who have high levels of social support/self-esteem and are willing to communicate are more likely to possess high levels of academic engagement. There was no significant relationship found between eagerness towards SNS usage and academic engagement. Moreover, this study is significant as it suggests that a student-veteran’s level of academic engagement is positively correlated to their overall level of academic engagement.

Unfortunately, schools have addressed school safety concerns by increasing exclusionary measures such as suspensions and expulsions. Knowing that exclusionary measures can have detrimental effects, state legislatures have called for more proactive strategies for positive student behavior and increased school climates. Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports is a proactive, school-wide approach to discipline that shifts the focuses from punitive measure to teaching, promoting, and supporting positive behavior to all students (Suagai & Horner, 2006). As a result, PBIS has been linked to positive school climates and reductions in exclusionary measures. This mixed methods study examined the implementation efforts and barriers to sustained implementation of PBIS in three urban school districts in Northern California. A modified version of the School-Wide Evaluation Tool (SET) was sent to the school site administrators in the three urban school districts in Northern California that had participated in a four day PBIS training. A small return rate was yielded (n=17), therefore only summary data could be reported. School site administrators indicated that the following practices were in place: three to five positively stated rules, rules were posted throughout the campus, a PBIS team has been established, the administrator was an active participant on the team, and an acknowledgment system had been implemented. Discipline data was analyzed from pre-implementation in 2010-2011 and after implementation in 2014-2015 using Paired t-Tests. Results indicated that there was statistical significance for overall suspension, expulsion and truancy data of the three school districts. Wilcoxon signed ranks tests were also conducted on pre-implementation and implementation discipline data by ethnicity and types of discipline. No statistical significance was noted for ethnicity and discipline type, but reductions in the number of suspensions and expulsions for various ethnic groups (i.e. African-Americans, Hispanics, and Whites) and discipline types (i.e. violence, disruptive/defiance, and physical injury) were indicated pre-implementation and after implementation.

In a single session, participants (undergraduate students, N = 80), answered two MCQs. One of the MCQs was the standard Kirby et al.

Within-subject results suggest that individual k values are consistent when comparing k values from the two MCQs completed by each individual. In most cases, individual k values between MCQs did not vary substantially. Additionally, there was a statistically significant correlation between both MCQ administrations for each group.

Therefore, most organisms communicate using one medium. Some anurans vocalize at the interface of air and water, though reception of these vocalizations is generally unknown. The túngara frog ( Engystomops pustulosus ) may be the first anuran to have evidence suggesting simultaneous acoustic communication both above and below the air-water interface. This thesis addresses whether the female túngara frog would be receptive to underwater acoustic signals and if males project their advertisement calls at biologically relevant intensities underwater. Females floated and swam with their eardrums and body walls constantly submerged. Using laser Doppler vibrometry, peak vibrations of female eardrums were found to be centered at about 3.5 kHz in air, but dropped to about 1.4 kHz underwater. The peak velocity of the eardrum was about 0.2 mm/s in air and 0.04 mm/s in water when stimulated with tones at 80 dB relative to 20 µPa. Males projected their advertisement calls with a sound pressure level of 121 dB (at 10 cm, re. 20 µPa) in water and 98 dB (at 10 cm, re. 20 µPa) in air. In relation to air, the dominant frequency of the advertisement call (0.8 kHz) was the most intense spectral band underwater whereas the dominant frequency of the chuck (2.5 kHz in air) was less intense. The advertisement signal for the male túngara frog was broadcasted underwater with more energy than in air at its main frequencies. Female eardrums were sensitive to frequencies within the male advertisement call both in air and in water, if the frequencies were transmitted at amplitudes plausible to be encountered in nature. These results strengthen the available evidence of underwater communication, and indicate the presence of auditory specializations in the acoustic communication of this species.",Biological Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1170&context=uop_etds,2016,-4.7654076,-10.579643,Amphibian communication Coupling of acoustic systems to the medium at the air-water interface,"Tang, J."

Filarial parasites vary among species of vertebrate hosts and can cause varying symptoms in hosts, including death. The presence of filarial parasites can influence host populations and can be costly to infected areas. To evaluate the prevalence of filarial parasites in Lake County, CA, mosquitoes were collected in 2014 and analyzed for infection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Of 1,008 mosquito pools, six filarial parasite species were detected in 23 pools representing six mosquito species. The DNA of Dirofilaria immitis (n=6, MIR=0.26); Setaria yehi (n=9, MIR=1.44); Splendidofilaria sp. (n=4, MIR=0.20); unknown filarial parasites A (n=2, MIR=0.09), B (n=1, MIR=0.41), and C (n=1, MIR=0.05) were detected in Aedes increpitus, Aedes sierrensis, Anopheles franciscanus, Anopheles freeborni, Culex stigmatosoma, and Culex tarsalis mosquito pools. Due to the presence of D. immitis, which can lead to chronic illness and death in domestic dogs, in Lake County it is important to evaluate vector competency of D. immitis in mosquito species. Culex tarsalis was chosen due to the high abundance found in Lake County in 2014 (n=36,587). To evaluate vector competency of Cx. tarsalis in transmission of D. immitis, colony and field-caught Lake County (n=102, n=54 respectively) mosquitoes were analyzed for infectivity using decapitation. Fourteen days post feeding on infected blood, mosquitoes were decapitated to evaluate the presence of L 3 larvae; but no L 3 larvae were detected. The presence of D. immitis DNA was detected in eight colony (IR=7.8%) and fifteen field-caught (IR=23.1%) thoraces using PCR. Though no L 3 larvae were observed in decapitated mosquitoes, presence of D. immitis DNA in the thoraces of mosquitoes using PCR has previously been used as an indicator for vector competency. Thus it is probable that Cx. tarsalis is a competent vector for D. immitis.",Biological Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&context=uop_etds,2016,-4.648452,-16.886562,Filarial infection in mosquitoes of Northern California,"Tran, T."

Dental graduates today are expected to have knowledge and possess skills at the competence level in order to provide care for the growing number of patients seeking this treatment option, which may be the optimal option for the majority of their cases. However, very little is known about current trends, issues, and perspectives of implant dentistry education. This study builds a knowledge base about implant dentistry education in pre-doctoral dental education programs. It begins with an overview of the current state of implant dentistry education described in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 evaluates faculty perception in Kuwait University Faculty of Dentistry regarding case-based-learning, a pedagogy that has been recommended by multiple dental education institutions as the context within which pre-doctoral implant dentistry education should be taught.

However, it can also be a risk factor for youth. Despite the large body of literature that delineates the benefits of sports participation and the negative outcomes associated with divorce, researchers have yet to examine the impact of athletic participation on youth who have experienced familial disruptions, such as divorce, separation, and remarriage. Sports participation was chosen as a moderating variable in the present study, as it is believed to serve as a protective factor for those who experience parental divorce. Specifically, the present study aims to answer the following research question: Does sports participation moderate the effects of parent marital status and belongingness on achievement and behavior problems after controlling for sex, socioeconomic status, and maternal education? Many theoretical mechanisms support the hypothesis that positive outcomes are be associated with sporting programs, such as Social Capital Theory, as well as theories associated with 7 motivation and belonging.

Pluripotent stem cell-based systems can facilitate developmental neurotoxicity studies because disturbances in nervous system development can be modeled in vitro. In this study, neurons derived from embryonal carcinoma (EC) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, were first characterized to establish their suitability for developmental neurotoxicity studies. The EC stem cell line, TERA2.cl.SP-12, was differentiated into neurons that expressed voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels as well as ionotropic GABA and glutamate receptors. These cells could also fire action potentials when stimulated electronically. However spontaneous action potentials were not observed. In contrast, pre-differentiated neurons derived from iPS cells fired evoked and spontaneous action potentials. Furthermore, iPS cell-derived neurons also expressed a wide array of functional voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are associated with developmental neurotoxicity. These agents can cause congenital malformations, cognitive deficits and behavioral impairment in children as a result of in utero exposure. The impact of four major AEDs, namely phenobarbital, valproic acid, carbamazepine and lamotrigine, on cell viability, cell cycle and differentiation of TERA2.cl.SP-12 into neurons was studied. All AEDs tested reduced differentiating stem cell viability. Valproic acid and carbamazepine increased apoptosis and reduced cell proliferation. A brief exposure to phenobarbital, valproic acid and lamotrigine at the start of differentiation impaired the subsequent generation of neurons. Additionally, the effect of transient exposure to phenobarbital and carbamazepine on neuronal maturation of iPS-derived neurons was investigated. Exposure to both AEDs resulted in diminished membrane potentials and reduced the proportion of cells that were able to fire action potentials spontaneously in culture. The data from these studies suggest that impairments in proliferation, differentiation and maturation of neurons derived from human stem cells may be sensitive indicators of neurodevelopmental disruption by these drugs that can result from in utero exposure. Furthermore, these findings suggest that the use of human pluripotent stem cells and neurons derived from them can reduce the time, cost and the number of animals used in toxicological research.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1130&context=uop_etds,2015,-21.240171,-8.124247,Characterization and application of human pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons to evaluate the risk of developmental neurotoxicity with antiepileptic drugs in vitro,"Cao, W."

Dunn Carlton,"Higher Education Administration, Health education, Education, Alcohol, College drinking, Prevention education, Standard drink","This exploratory study ( n =55) informs efforts aimed at addressing the problem of collegiate high-risk drinking by evaluating the effectiveness of three methods for teaching standard drink measures to first-year college students. These methods include the use of numeric measures in ounces, two-dimensional (2-D) images, and three-dimensional (3-D) models. All of these represent the appropriate volume for four standard drinks—beer, wine, hard alcohol, and alcohol contained in one mixed drink—as defined by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). By increasing students’ knowledge of standard drink measures and their own accurate pouring ability, they may improve their efficacious use of protective strategies, including tracking of the number of drinks they consume. In this study, when the distinction between over-pouring and under-pouring was eliminated and the absolute values of the percentages of inaccurate pouring became the focus, all three interventions were found to improve the accuracy of the ability to pour standard-size mixed drinks. Although violations to some of the statistical assumptions underlying ANOVA precluded use of this inferential technique to directly compare the three interventions, the data analytic approaches used did suggest that both the 2-D and the 3-D interventions may be more beneficial, overall, than the NIAAA numerical intervention. Associations between knowledge of standard drink measures, self-efficacy in pouring standard drinks, self-efficacy in using protective strategies, use of protective strategies, pouring accuracy, alcohol consumption, and negative consequences associated with alcohol usage were explored. Use of 3-D standard drink models offers prevention educators a simple yet potentially more effective method for teaching students and can be conducted easily in a variety of educational settings. Additionally, this type of education may ultimately improve the accuracy of data collection on student drinking.

Therefore, they either avoid drinking caffeinated beverages altogether, or they avoid drinking them close to bedtime to prevent caffeine from interfering with their sleep. Ruta Cleanse and Ruta Sleep are natural supplements containing rutaecarpine that are designed to speed up the removal of caffeine from the blood. The recommendation is to take two capsules (equivalent to 100 mg rutaecarpine), as needed, to reduce caffeine level. Customers have reported positive effects, when taken 30 minutes to 2 hours prior. However, there is no scientific data to show how soon Ruta Cleanse and Ruta Sleep need to be taken in order for it to work. Therefore, we tested in rats the effect of single dose after 3, 6, 12, 24 hour and 7 doses (once a day, for seven days) of oral 100 mg/kg rutaecarpine (in suspension) induction on caffeine pharmacokinetics upon 15 mg/kg intravenous bolus and 20 mg/kg oral caffeine doses. The MROD data showed that as early as 3 hours after oral rutaecarpine administration, CYP1A2 activity in the liver tissue is increased by almost 3-fold compared to control rats and highest activity (9-fold compared to control) is found in the liver of rats administered with daily oral dose of rutaecarpine, for seven days. A suspension form of 100 mg/kg orally administered rutaecarpine significantly decreases the oral systemic exposure and mean residence time of caffeine and its metabolites (paraxanthine, theophylline and theobromine), as early as 3 hours before oral caffeine administration. The oral caffeine bioavailability (F) decreases by about 50% for the 3, 6 and 12-hour, 70% for the 24 hour and 80% for the one week daily rutaecarpine treatment groups. Currently we do not know the mechanism by which rutaecarpine significantly decreases the F values of caffeine upon oral administration. The systemic exposure of caffeine and its metabolites are also decreased when caffeine is given intravenously, though the effect is less pronounced compared to when caffeine is given orally. Interestingly, rutaecarpine achieves this effect without achieving detectable plasma level (less than 10 ng/mL). However, since the target organ for rutaecarpine is the liver, rutaecarpine can still induce CYP1A2 enzyme in the liver (as indicated by MROD data), without having to get absorbed into blood circulation.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1275&context=uop_etds,2015,-3.9519336,-17.208807,Effect of rutaecarpine on caffeine pharmacokinetics in rats,"Estari, R."

Drawing on Bandura's Social Learning Theory framework (1977) and the work of Palmer (2011), this study sought to explore student-athlete drinking practices and the social value of said practices to better understand why high drinking rates may occur. The participants were 65 student-athletes enrolled at Mason University, a NCAA Division I University located on the west coast. The study employed mixed methods, which combined quantitative (online questionnaire) and qualitative (interview) tools. Findings revealed that (a) student-athletes remain at high risk of heavy drinking practices; (b) the social value of alcohol was demonstrated, specifically in its use as a socialization tool; and (c) drinking practices were influenced by varied team drinking cultures, which may have significant effects on team cohesion.

The results demonstrated that participants preferred single player video games due to less interruption from social interactions with online multiplayer games, but also to avoid harassment and negative criticisms that continue to plague online multiplayer experiences. Results also suggest that participants seek solitude while engaging with video games in order to become immersed within the game for a more relaxed and fun experience. Gratification dimensions were included from previous research including: arousal, challenge, competition, diversion, fantasy, and social interaction. Several new dimensions not matching previous research were discovered in the data that provided new perspectives on why players engage with single player video games. The participants discussed that single player video games could be played at their own pace, stopped at any time, and then continue their experience at their leisure.

However, in China, compared with the growing enthusiasm in debate among the Chinese students, research in this field is relatively thin. Therefore, in order to gain an in-depth understanding of how forensic participation influence students’ critical thinking abilities, I conducted this multiple case study which was grounded in the Paul-Elder Model of Critical Thinking. My respondents are three national or regional champions from a well-known forensic team in Eastern China. My major data collection include three one-on-one interviews with the respondents, some secondary interviews with their coach and teachers, observations on their debate training, and some online data such as the official blog of the team, my e-mail correspondence with the students and information culled from their personal social networking sites. My two research questions are “How does college students’ thinking change as a result of participating in forensics?” and “What features of forensic participation support students’ development of critical thinking?” In terms of research question one, I have found that first, as a result of forensic participation, my respondents’ questioning, critical reading, analyzing and evaluating skills have improved. Second, they developed some intellectual traits that are indispensable to their critical thinking abilities. Third, forensic participation has to some extent helped them to get rid of ego-centric and socio-centric thinking, which paved the way for them to become an accomplished and responsible thinker. As to research question two, I found that both the educational and epistemic features support students’ development of critical thinking. I also found out motivation plays such an important role in students’ critical thinking development that it could be added into the framework of Paul’s Model of critical thinking.

Solubility of a drug in aqueous media is a pre-requisite to achieve desired concentration of a drug in the systemic circulation. Low aqueous solubility is a major problem encountered with formulation development of recently designed new chemical entities. Solubility of poorly soluble drugs is enhanced by physical and chemical modifications of drug. Shake flask method is the most commonly used experimental method to determine solubility. However, this method has several limitations. A single solubility experiment can go on for several days and even weeks. Besides this, a large amount of drug is required to carry out the experiment. In order to overcome this and make initial screening easier, computational method can be used to predict solubility. In this study, the solubility of 12 small molecules of BCS class II having a wide range of physicochemical properties were studied to enhance their solubility by hot melt method. Three different grades of PEG (1450, 4000, 8000), PVP K17 and Urea as the hydrophilic carriers was employed for the solubility enhancement. The overall objective of this investigation is to develop a model that could estimate enhanced solubility using physicochemical descriptors. Multiple linear regression (MLR), a statistical tool, was used to generate a equation for the solubility by correlating physicochemical properties of the drug like- molecular size, logP, pKa, HBA, HBD, melting point, polar surface area, and number of rotatable bonds. Solubility enhancement is also influenced by the carrier used, we included the physicochemical properties of the carriers like molecular weight and solubility parameter in the development of the model. MLR analysis model, resulted in an equation, where, Log solubility = 5.982-0.010 MW (drug)-0.452 LogP-0.320 HBA-0.095 ?solubility parameter+0.015 MV. A regression analysis yielded a good fit with a regression value (adjusted R2) of 0.74. The model has been validated by leave one out method.

As a result, many labs across the globe are racing to manufacture synthetic dragline silk fibers. With the production of synthetic dragline silk fibers, there are unlimited commercial applications. In this study, we developed several codon-optimized MaSp1 minifibroin constructs for recombinant protein expression in bacteria. These recombinant MaSp1 minifibroin constructs were engineered to contain the N-terminal domain (NTD), different copies of internal block repeats (ranging from 2 to 64 copies of 35 amino acid blocks), and the C-terminal domain (CTD). The NTD and CTDs were derived from the natural cDNA sequences of black widow spiders, while the internal block repeats were generated from synthetic DNA fragments that were codon-optimized for expression in Escherichia coli . Different numbers of internal block repeats were created using a specialized seamless cloning strategy. By applying this seamless cloning strategy, we successfully multimerized MaSp1 block repeats that approach the natural fibroin size. Moreover, through the construction of a customized NTD-CTD spidroin construct, multimerized block repeats from any fibroin can be rapidly inserted to facilitate minifibroin protein expression in bacteria.

Advertisement signals vary in complexity and their diversity can be best understood through the study of the simplest case, in which a species with a single-note mating call evolves a second note. Túngara frogs ( Engystomops pustulosus ) provide the best-known example of complex calling among frogs. The initial part of the mating call, called ""whine"", is always present and mediates species recognition. The frog can facultatively add one to seven additional notes called ""chucks"" to the mating call. Frogs initiate phonation by compressing pulmonary air to pass it through the larynx, inducing vibration of vocal cords. In male túngara frogs, a pair of fibrous masses is attached to the vocal cords and vibrates to produce the chuck. The mechanism that controls the optional production of the chucks was previously unknown. This study examined the muscles of the larynx thought most likely to be involved in controlling the production of the chuck. Four pairs of laryngeal muscles were previously known in amphibians. The laryngeal dilator muscle is the largest of them and has the role of opening the larynx. In the túngara frog, the laryngeal dilator muscle is divided into two bundles of fibers with distinct attachments. The superficial bundle of the dilator muscle originates at the posteromedial process of the hyoid cartilage and inserts medially into the arytenoid cartilages. The deep bundle attaches to the medial aspect of the arytenoid cartilages and to the base of the fibrous mass, extending through a fissure between the cricoid and arytenoid cartilages. This attachment to the fibrous mass may allow the deep bundle of the laryngeal dilator muscle to control the vibration of the fibrous mass and the production of the chuck. This possibility was evaluated by examination of the muscle innervations and by electrical stimulation. The long laryngeal nerve innervates all laryngeal muscles except the deep portion of the laryngeal dilator muscle, which is innervated by the short laryngeal nerve. Electrical stimulation confirmed that the long laryngeal nerve stimulates all laryngeal muscles, except the deep portion of the laryngeal dilator muscle. Stimulation of the short laryngeal nerve only resulted in contraction of the deep portion of the laryngeal dilator muscle, which leads to the fibrous mass. These results indicate that the short laryngeal nerve controls the deep portion of the laryngeal dilator muscle, which may position the fibrous masses in a way that allows them to vibrate with airflow adding chucks to the mating call. The deep portion of the laryngeal dilator should be recognized as a separate muscle in the amphibian larynx, for having distinct attachments, innervation and role. The recognition of this muscle resolves the issue of multiple innervation of the laryngeal dilator muscle in amphibians. Based on innervation, the new muscle is likely homologous to the mammalian cricothyroid muscle.",Biological Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1174&context=uop_etds,2015,-8.98767,1.1155765,Muscular control of vocal complexity in the túngara frog (Engystomops pustulosus),"Mulhim, R."

Many of the new therapeutically beneficial compounds discovered are lipophilic requiring various solubility enhancement strategies to improve their solubility. Among these strategies, solubility enhancement using solid dispersions is a leading method. To obtain a desirable increase in the solubility of a poorly-soluble compound, a good understanding of the molecular descriptors influencing the enhancement of solubility is essential. Therefore, the major research objective was to determine the descriptors which significantly influence the solubility enhancement by solid dispersions. After enhancing the solubility of selected poorly-soluble model compounds, a regression analysis was performed to determine the correlation of molecular descriptors of the active agent, polymer, and solvent with solubility enhancement. The partition co-efficient, hydrogen bonding and solubility parameters of polymer and water were found to influence the aqueous solubility of the poorly-soluble compounds. Aqueous solubility of a compound had an inverse relation with difference in solubility parameters of polymer and water. Similarly partition coefficient was found to be inversely related to aqueous solubility. However for an increase in hydrogen bond acceptors present in pharmaceutical agents increased their solubility, while the higher number hydrogen bond donors resulted in lower solubility. This complexity can be attributed to the contribution of hydrogen bonding in a crystal lattice and in aqueous environment. In conclusion, the contribution of partition co-efficient, solubility parameter and hydrogen bonding were found to be significant for a given set of poorly-soluble model compounds selected with a wide range of descriptors. Several models estimating aqueous solubility of compounds have been employed as screening tool in drug development process. However, all such models were developed to estimate aqueous solubility of pure active agents. Hence, the second research objective was to develop a model that could estimate aqueous solubility of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) in solubility-enhanced solid dispersions. Using multiple linear regression, a computational model was developed using the molecular descriptors of poorly-soluble compound, polymer and water. S=(2.02*HBA)-(3.37*??)-(11.56*log?P )-(0.9*HBD)+119.66 The model showed a regression (R2) value of 0.858.

Educators are subjected to work environments that are in a state of constant change brought about by continuous series of new educational policies that teachers are tasked to implement within their classrooms. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to examine how five elementary school teachers experienced and responded to educational policy changes that influenced their instructional practices. This study also investigated the role and influence school sub-cultures had on elementary school teacher's experiences of and responses to educational policy change, and the role school sub-cultures played in teacher-initiated change during periods of policy change. Data were collected through focus groups, interviews, and journal response by teacher-participants. This study was framed by two concepts: communities of practice , by which individuals, who share common concerns or passions, interact with others routinely to learn from one another in a way that improves his or her particular practice, and organizational culture which views organizations as structures that consist of multiple smaller groups or cultures. Following the phenomenological data analysis process described by Creswell and Patten, the primary themes that emerged from the experiences of the five teachers in this study were: 1) Perceived student academic needs , 2) The influence of the principal , 3) Curriculum changes and professional communities , 4) Professional development , 5) Grade level team influences , 6) Teacher identity , and 7) Teacher emotion . Findings of this study provide a deeper understanding of: teacher decision-making as they try to understand and integrate new policies into their instructional practices, the importance of how school principals lead and support teachers during periods of policy change, the inconsistency of professional support provided by their school district, and how changes in professional networks brought about by policy changes create conflict between teachers identities and altered educational environments.

Recently a number of monoclonal antibodies and their drug conjugates have been approved as therapeutic agents. While these molecules have great potential in various applications and therapeutics, extensive use of full length antibodies has been hampered by the high cost of production, large molecular weight and limited ability to penetrate tumor tissues. These limitations have led to the research for antibody alternatives with lower molecular weight, similar binding and affinity properties but without the lengthy and complicate process of generating antibodies. Some examples of these efforts include minibodies, fragment antigen binding (FAB), ScFv, and synthetic antibody mimics. Although these antibody alternatives have low molecular weight, as compared to the antibody, they are either derived from full size antibodies or by a long and tedious in vitro screening process. Therefore, a rational design of molecules that mimic antibody binding is a logical first step for the development of antibody alternatives. In this study, a novel approach to design antibody mimics without involving massive experimental screening was developed. The design was developed by mapping and identifying EGFR epitope region where Cetuximab CDR binds and modifying sequences using knob-socket computational model. The binding of antibody mimics were first analyzed by using MOE to obtain the binding energy, total and preserved interactions as compared to the interactions between EGFR and Cetuximab. Further, the designed antibody mimics were used to form a peptide drug conjugate (PDC). Antibody mimics were found to specifically bind and internalized by EGFR overexpressing cell lines with three to four folds higher than control cells. Antibody mimics showed binding in nanomolar range with Pep11 with binding affinity (K D ) of 252nM as shown by SPR studies. EGFR phosphorylation studies also showed that antibody mimics were able to inhibit the binding of EGF to the EGFR in a similar fashion as Cetuximab. Specific binding, affinity and functional activity of the antibody mimics demonstrated that these peptides were able to mimic all the three important characteristics of antibodies. Peptide drug conjugate (PDC) was found to be around 10 fold more potent as compared to the drug itself towards EGFR overexpressed cancer cells. PDC also showed more than 100 fold low potency against control cells. These studies demonstrated that a rational design of molecules to mimic the antibody characteristics is feasible.

Spencer,"Educational evaluation, Educational leadership, Literacy, Reading instruction, Education, Applied behavioral analysis, English language development, Reading intervention, Response to intervention, Silent sustained reading","With the ratification of the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA) in 2006, states were required to permit public schools to provide varying levels of intervention for students who showed that they were struggling in one or more core educational areas (Department of Education 300.307(a) (2), 2006). This recommendation supported the use of the framework known as Response to Intervention (RtI) that was familiar in the research literature (Department of Education, 2006). The theoretical framework chosen to support the RtI process in which three RtI programs are being analyzed is Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). ABA is a theory that suggests interventions initiated to create improvement for an area in which a person has learning or developmental challenges needs to be carefully evaluated individually with each case and then a series of proactive responses to the data are initiated with the goal of having the individual experience improvement and growth (Axelrod, 2012). Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare the CST reading proficiency scores of socio-economically challenged middle school students who participated in one of three interventions: low reading students who participated in an intensive reading program, low reading students who participated in the English Language Development (ELD) program, and low reading students who only participated in a Sustained Silent Reading program. The methodology chosen was a quasi-experimental study because there were three independent variables: the Intensive Intervention Group (II), the English Language Development Intervention Group (ELD), and the Silent Sustained Reading Intervention Group (SSR). A Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was conducted on all three independent variables using the dependent variable to establish any significant differences and to measure any possible academic mean growth. Two research questions were analyzed, including how the three groups scores would compare using the MANOVA and the impact of the interventions when comparing sixth, seventh, and eighth graders to each other as separate groups.

Overexpression of HER2 is found in various cancers including breast, ovarian, gastric, colon, and non-small-cell lung cancers, which makes it an attractive target for cancer therapy. Specific antibodies, peptides and small molecules are developed by scientists to bind with HER2 as therapeutical agents, dimerization inhibitors and biological makers. Among these molecules, antibodies showed excellent binding affinity and specificity toward HER2. However, uses of antibodies are limited by their high cost of production, long development time, limited ability to penetrate tumor tissue and immunogenicity. Many of these limitations are due to the high molecular weight of antibodies. Compared to antibodies, peptides and small molecule that selectively recognize HER2 have advantages in solubility, permeability and immunogenicity. So far, the design of all peptides and small molecules for binding with HER2 either utilize phage display technique or rely on computational screen of large library of millions of small molecules. These approaches all suffer from the drawbacks of tedious, labor intensive, and time consuming as well as uncertainty of outcome. In this study, it was hypothesized that a novel approach based on molecular interactions of HER2-Pertuzumab complex and Knob-Socket model can be developed to design antibody mimics for targeting HER2. All designed antibody mimics were simulated and docked with HER2 using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software to estimate binding energy and analyze the detail interaction map. A series of mimics were then synthesized and characterized. HER2 positive breast cancer cells MDA-MB-361 and ZR-75-1 were used in confocal microscopic and flow cytometric studies to evaluate the binding specificity of all antibody mimics to HER2 in vitro, while human embryonic kidney cell (HEK293) was used as control. After incubation with antibody mimics, high fluorescence intensities were observed on MDA-MB-361 and ZR-75-1 cells, while only background fluorescence were observed on HEK293 cells. Surface plasma resonance (SPR) studies showed that all antibody mimics bind to HER2 protein with KD value in range of 55.4 nM- 525.5 nM. Western blot technique was used to evaluate inhibition capability of antibody mimics on phosphorylation of HER2 downstream signaling Akt and MAPK pathways that were crucial for cell differentiation and survival. When treated with antibody mimics at 10µM for 24 h, more than 85% phosphorylation of Akt pathway was inhibited while phosphorylation of MAPK pathway was not affected. This finding proved that antibody mimics could bind to HER2 extracellular domain and selectively inhibit the dimerization between HER2 and HER3 to block phosphorylation of Akt pathway in a similar way as Pertuzumab. In addition, in vivo studies on tumor bearing nude mice were carried out to investigate the distribution and binding specificity of antibody mimics towards HER2 positive tumor after injecting through vein tail. Signal intensity ratio (SIR) of tumor to muscle revealed about 10-fold increase in tumor retention of HER2-PEP11 compared to the Cy7.5 carboxylic acid and Cy7.5-HER2-PEP22, which confirmed excellent in vivo binding specificity of antibody mimic HER2-PEP11 to HER2 positive tumor.

The study also examines the relationship between the variables of identification and similarity as a process of social comparison. Sixty-five students from a small, private University located in the northwestern United States participated in a classical pretest-posttest experiment consisting of two groups. The treatment in this study was a Facebook account that was designed to induce feelings of upward social comparison amongst the participants through the use of status updates, photos and comments from a female college student. The self-esteem and social comparison levels of the participants were measured after viewing the Facebook treatment to determine whether or not the participants experienced a change in their self-esteem, as a result of engaging in upward social comparison with the Facebook treatment. The degree to which the participants identified with the Facebook treatment and also the degree to which the participants viewed the Facebook treatment as someone who was similar to themselves was also measured to determine whether or not identification and similarity play a role in social comparison. The results revealed that the participants did not experience a significant decrease in self-esteem after viewing the Facebook treatment. Furthermore, a correlation analysis indicated no significant relationship between the identification and similarity variables and the self-esteem and social comparison variables. However, additional findings revealed a significant correlation between high self-esteem and downward social comparison.

Poor relationships between students and teachers can lead to many negative outcomes, such as school failure and risky behaviors. While this relationship has been analyzed often, it is typically from the point of view of the teacher rather than the student. Individual cognitive appraisals of both efficacy and attribution impact how feedback from teachers is interpreted. Of particular interest is whether individuals attribute academic failures to external sources, such as teachers, which could impact the 5 teacher-student relationship. Determining factors that influence students' perceptions of teachers has implications for both student- and teacher-centered interventions. Data on academic self-efficacy, self-concept, locus of control, and perception of teachers was obtained from a racially diverse population of approximately 500 participants from a Catholic high school in Northern California. Path analysis was used to analyze possible causal relationships. Results indicate that both academic self-efficacy and locus of control significantly impact students' attitudes toward teachers. Locus of control was also found to partially mediate the relationship between academic self-efficacy and perceptions of teachers. Boosting academic self-efficacy will likely improve students' perceptions of their teachers.

Most of the NCE’s are lipophilic and have dissolution rate issues. Low dissolution rate of the drugs result in poor bioavailability. To overcome poor bioavailability, an adsorption technique is developed to enhance the apparent dissolution rate of poorly-water soluble drugs. In this study, two poor-water soluble model drugs, ibuprofen and carvedilol were used. Methanol, DMF, DMSO and PEG400 were used as solvents and microcrystalline cellulose was used as an adsorbent. Pure model drugs, physical mixtures and prepared composites were characterized by using FTIR, DSC, XRD and dissolution testing. Results showed that the composites prepared with solvents DMF, DMSO and PEG400 showed enhancement in dissolution rates of two model drugs. Characterization of the composites prepared by using non-volatile solvents showed successful conversion of crystalline model drugs into solution state. Whereas, composites prepared by using volatile solvent showed similar results like physical mixtures and pure drug. Ibuprofen composites containing DMF, DMSO and PEG400 showed 9.4, 7.4 and 1.8 folds of increase in apparent dissolution rate, respectively. Whereas carvedilol composites containing DMF and DMSO showed 11.52 and 3.4 folds of increase in apparent dissolution rate. Four months of stability study were conducted on prepared composites at both 40°C and room temperature. It was observed that prepared composites were stable after 4 months and exhibited similar dissolution rate. In conclusion, the use of non-volatile solvents disrupted the crystal structure but also retained the drug in solution state which in turn enhanced the apparent dissolution rate of model drugs used. From the observed results we conclude that this method has a potential to replace existing techniques to enhance the apparent dissolution rate of the drug and stability of the composites.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1268&context=uop_etds,2015,-9.284031,1.0781024,Apparent dissolution rate enhancement of poorly-water soluble drugs by adsorption technique,"Vutukuru, N."

However, limitations exist as some proteins cannot be secreted efficiently even with the MAT α prepro secretion signal. Some strategies to enhance secretion efficiency involved modifying the secretion signal leader. Based on the knob-socket model and Jpred3 ( a secondary structure predictor), eleven deletions of MAT α prepro secretion signal and one MAT α pre double pro-peptide mutant was engineered and assayed with either horseradish peroxidase (HRP), or Candida antarctica lipase B reporter protein to evaluate the correlation between secondary structure and secretion level. In addition, structural analysis through circular dichroism was completed for the wild type pro-peptide and a mutant pro-peptide to evaluate differences in secondary structure. Results suggest pro-peptide amino acids 75-78 play an important role in determining secretion level and a higher secretion level tends to associate with secondary structures that are less defined.

Using a quasi-experimental research design, this dissertation study examined the effectiveness of a backward-designed assessment training course for improving the assessment literacy levels of pre-service primary teachers who were participating in college-level teacher preparation programs in Shanghai. Two extant naturally formed classes, within which the eighty pre-service primary teachers from a private pre-service teacher education institution XT in Shanghai fit the participants recruiting criterion, were used to serve as the treatment and control groups. Framed by the design approach of Understanding by Design (UbD) developed by Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe (2005), an assessment training program was developed and provided for those in the treatment group during a 12-week period of time; in contrast, those in the control group were not provided with any assessment-related courses. For all the participants, their levels of assessment literacy were measured twice, before and after the intervention, by using the Chinese version of the Assessment Literacy Inventory (Mertler & Campbell, 2005) which I modified further to better meet the context of this study. Results of the study suggest that: 1) among the courses (excluding the intervention itself) provided for the pre-service primary teachers involved in this study, limited efforts had been made to prepare the pre-service teachers for their future assessing tasks; 2) due to the inadequacy of assessment training, most of the Chinese pre-service teachers being tested were not initially literate enough in their assessment knowledge or practice; and 3) whether or not one participates in the assessment training course is a statistically significant predictor of pre-service teachers' assessment literacy, with their previous assessment literacy controlled. In other words, with the embedded theoretical framework of UbD, the designed assessment literacy training course appears to have had a large positive impact on improving pre-service teachers’ assessment competency ( F (1, 77) = 135.91, p 2 partial = .638).",Education,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1010&context=uop_etds,2015,16.25683,-3.0967238,The development of assessment literacy in Chinese pre-service primary teachers,"Yan, B."

Therefore, in recent years, the core educational aim of design education in China shifted emphasis from training students in skills such as drawing and painting, toward encouraging them to be creative and become problem-solvers. Based on a non-equivalent control group, pretest- posttest design, this quasi-experimental study examined the effectiveness of a creativity course in developing creative thinking in Chinese university design students. The researcher developed a ten-week course plan in concordance with Davis’ AUTA model (1982) (a model of creativity development based on Awareness, Understanding, Techniques, and Self-Actualization) to improve students’ creative thinking. This research design used a convenience sample of two first-year design classes that comprised a treatment group of 31 students and a control group of 31 students, making a total of 62 participants. The treatment group took the ten-week creativity training course, whereas the control group did not attend the course. ANCOVA was used to analyze the pretest and posttest scores for the Figural Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. The results showed there were significant differences between the treatment group and control group on overall posttest scores and three subscores of creativity thinking in Fluency, Originality and Elaboration. Although there were no significant differences in two subscores of creative thinking, the treatment group did show improvement on all five subscores. The results demonstrated that the ten-week creativity training course improved design students’ creativity level, especially in the overall creative thinking. Recommendations for both educational policy makers and educators based on this study include: a) allowing creativity enhancing instruction as separate courses to become an integral part of the design educational process and no longer consider it as the inessential of the design curricula; b) providing students more opportunities to use creative skills and creative thinking techniques to solve real design problems; c) providing pre-service and in-service teacher training programs to implement creativity instruction effectively.",Education,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1011&context=uop_etds,2015,3.3758166,-2.2343178,The effectiveness of a creativity course on developing Chinese design students' creative thinking,"Zhu, H."

Due to its lowest oxidation potential (1.29 eV), guanine is the most easily oxidisable nucleobase. Furthermore, it has been observed that the 5'-guanine in G-tracts (e.g. GGG) has even lower oxidation potential (1.00 V vs. NHE). One of the representative G-rich examples is telomeres that consist of repeating units of 5'-d [TTAGGG]-3' found at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres play an important role in biological functions, serving as guardians of genome stability; however, their G-rich nature implies that they can be readily oxidized. So how does nature protect these biologically important regions from oxidation? We believe the formation of a secondary structure known as G-Quadruplex in telomeric regions can partly serve as a protective role. In the first part of this work, we investigated DNA G-Quadruplex damage under various oxidation conditions and compare the damage results with single-stranded telomeric sequences. Damage to G-Quadruplex is generally less than single strands and is condition dependent. Guanines are the primary damage sites, but damage of adenine and thymine is also possible. Based on our studies, telomeric DNA can be readily oxidized to produce DNA lesions. How do DNA lesions affect the conformation and the stability of telomeric G-Quadruplex DNA? In the second part, we sought to address this question using various biophysical methods. Several native (OxodG, OxodA, and abasic site) and non-native (8-NH 2 -dA and 8-Br-dA) lesions were tested. UV thermal denaturation and circular dichroism revealed that the conformation and the stability of G-Quadruplex DNA are dependent on the location and the type of lesion in the sequence. G-Quadruplex DNA containing OxodG maintains its conformation with a decreased stability. Abasic site in the TTA loop affects the conformation of G-Quadruplex DNA but shows little effect on its stability. An unexpected stabilization of telomeric G-Quadruplex DNA was observed when deoxyadenosine (dA) in the loops was replaced with its native oxidized form OxodA. This is the first example of native DNA lesion that increases the stability of G-Quadruplex DNA. Like OxodA lesion, 8-NH 2 -dA (a non native DNA lesion) increases the stability of G-Quadruplex DNA while 8-Br-dA only affects the stability in KCl but has no significant effect in NaCl. In addition, studies of the effect of OxodA lesion on the human telomerase activity using TRAP assay will be discussed.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1133&context=uop_etds,2014,-19.12617,-12.811837,Study of DNA damage on DNA G-quadruplexes and biophysical evaluation of the effects of modified bases (lesions) on their conformation and stability,"Aggrawal, M."

Interestingly, rodent and mouse ZIPK has undergone a divergence in regulation in comparison to other vertebrate orthologs including human. Whereas the human ortholog of ZIPK requires phosphorylation of residues TT299/300 for nuclear exit, rodents and mouse require interaction with another protein termed PAR-4. In this project we completed several experiments to examine zebrafish ZIPK in development and its effect on acto-myosin contractility. It was found that zebrafish ZIPK was expressed ubiquitously in maternal stages. In zygotic stages, ZIPK expression dropped dramatically and localized to the anterior portions of the embryo. Zebrafish and human ZIPK, but not rodent ZIPK were able to increase stress fiber formation and myosin light chain-2 (MLC-2) phosphorylation in vitro. Human and zebrafish ZIPK underwent nucleocytoplasmic shuttling without PAR-4 interaction, unlike rodent ZIPK, which required PAR-4 for nuclear exit. Unlike human ZIPK, zebrafish ZIPK TT299/300AA mutants were able to undergo shuttling. Similar to human ZIPK, catalytic mutations to zebrafish ZIPK abolished or dramatically reduced activity. Through these experiments we were able to show human and zebrafish ZIPK homologs function and are regulated similarly, while the rodent ZIPK was much more unique.

P. pastoris is able to produce from milligram to gram quantities of protein. In this study, we examined the effects of calcium and magnesium on growth, heterologous protein expression, and calcium homeostasis in P. pastoris . The divalent cations calcium and magnesium are responsible for diverse roles in in the function of the cells in eukaryotes. Although it is known that calcium is responsible for many biological functions in eukaryotes, there is a limited understanding of the calcium homeostasis in P. pastoris . In this study, we found that addition of calcium and magnesium to yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD) does not increase the cell growth of wild type P. pastoris . However, the original concentrations of calcium and magnesium in YPD were critical to cells, as removing calcium and magnesium using EGTA and EDTA, respectively, decreased the cell growth of wild type P. pastoris . Changes to cytoplasmic calcium concentration in P. pastoris was studied using the fluorescent calcium sensitive dye, indo-1 (10 μM) and fluorescent spectrophotometer. The intracellular calcium concentration increased with addition of calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, and phosphate buffered saline (PBS). PBS (standard 1x) induced a significantly higher increase in intracellular calcium concentration compared to inductions with calcium chloride (1.2 mM). Our results showed that the addition of calcium and magnesium into the growth medium did not increase the expression of alcohol oxidase-1 driven β-galactosidase expression. However, calcium and magnesium may still play crucial roles in protein expression as EDTA and EGTA caused an increase in β-galactosidase expression as indicated by higher β-galactosidase activity.

Self-polymerization of CRP1 is also shown to be independent of pH and salt concentration, two important chemical cues that help fibroin aggregation.

The extent to which these interventions are successful in improving behavior, and the degree to which the effects are maintained, relies heavily on the behavior of the parent after the completion of the training. Research suggests that parents' ability to use the skills taught during training diminishes over time. One variable suggested to contribute to parent nonadherence is negative reinforcement. To further investigate, the current study first taught parents correct implementation of a time out procedure, then through a series of practice sessions, manipulated role-player behavior in an attempt to directly observe and measure the effects of negative reinforcement on parent integrity. However, due to lack of responding and contact with the contingency, the effects of negative reinforcement could not be assessed.

The optimal [H 2 O 2 ]/[Fe 2+ ] molar ratio for COD removal was 3. An orthogonal test was designed based on the optimal molar [H 2 O 2 ]/[Fe 2+ ] ratio to evaluate the significance of four parameters relevant to the treatment process, namely, H 2 O 2 dosage, initial pH, oxidation time and coagulation pH. The influence of the following parameters on COD removal efficiency decreases as follows: H 2 O 2 dosage > oxidation time > coagulation pH > initial pH. The COD removal efficiency was investigated based on the most important single-factor parameter which was H 2 O 2 dosage, as discovered in the orthogonal test. A well-fitted empirical correlation was obtained in the single-factor analysis and up to 98% COD removal was attained using 50 mM H 2 O 2 . With the increase of H 2 O 2 dosage up to 50 mM, the COD removal efficiency increased rapidly due to a higher generation of hydroxyl radicals. However, this effect becomes less significant as the dosage of H 2 O 2 increases. This effect might be attributed to the consumption of hydroxyl radicals with excess H 2 O 2 .

Bending strength and micro-harness of the samples were compared. When 12g of anthracite was used, ionic iron (Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ ) content was reduced to 4.7% and total iron content was reduced to 8.0% in parent glass. The main crystalline phases formed were diopside and augite. Crystalline phases were well-distributed ranging between 0.2 to 0.4 µm after crystallization. A maximum bending strength of 91MPa and a maximum micro-hardness of 3466MPa were achieved. Effect of Al 2 O 3 content on glass-ceramics was studied. Both average bending strength and average micro-hardness of glass-ceramics with 15% Al 2 O 3 content were higher than the glass-ceramics with 6% Al 2 O 3 content. Blast furnace dust was used as both a reducing agent to recover iron and a raw material to prepare glass-ceramics. Compared with glass-ceramics using anthracite as the reducing agent, average bending strength of glass-ceramics formed using BF dust was lower, while average micro-hardness was higher.",Engineering,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1218&context=uop_etds,2014,-13.869548,3.7629576,Preparation of glass-ceramics largely using steelmaking slags and study on the effect of iron content on properties of glass-ceramics,"Feng, H."

The results indicated that early mother-child attachment did not predict teacher-child closeness after controlling for the demographic variables and prior internalizing problems. Mother-child attachment had a statistically significant effect on teacher-child conflict; specifically, those with insecure-controlling/insecure-other attachments had higher levels of conflict than those with secure attachments.

This study was designed to investigate whether there were sex differences in rat aortic endothelial function in diabetes, and to examine the potential roles of superoxide and nitric oxide (NO) in this sex-specific effect. Two diabetic animal models were used: streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetic rats (at early and intermediate stages of disease) and Zucker type 2 diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation (EDV) to acetylcholine (ACh) was measured in aortic rings pre-contracted with phenylephrine (PE) before and after pretreatment with MnTmPYP (10 mM), a superoxide scavenger, or apocynin (100 μM), a NADPH oxidase (Nox) inhibitor. Constrictor response curves (CRC) to PE (10 -8 to 10 -5 M) were also generated before and after pretreatment with L-NAME (200 μM), an endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) inhibitor, in the presence of indomethacin. In addition, the level of Nox (a potent source of superoxide) and eNOS mRNA expression were determined using real-time RT-PCR. STZ-induced diabetes impaired EDV to ACh to a greater extent in female than male aortae both at early and intermediate stage of disease (1- and 8- week, respectively). Incubation of aortic rings with L-NAME potentiated PE responses in all groups, but aortae from control females showed a greater potentiation of the PE response after NOS inhibition compared with others. STZ-diabetes reduced the extent of PE potentiation after L-NAME and the aortic eNOS mRNA expression in females to the same levels as seen in males. In addition, pre-incubation with MnTMPyP enhanced sensitivity to ACh only in diabetic females one week after STZ induction. Similarly, the levels of Nox1 mRNA expression were enhanced in STZ-induced diabetic females. Type 2 diabetes significantly impaired EDV in aortic rings from females; however, it potentiated the relaxation in male rats. Moreover, type 2 diabetes enhanced the extent of PE potentiation after blocking NOS with L-NAME in females. Pre-incubation of aortic rings with apocynin increased EDV only in diabetic female group. Accordingly, the levels of Nox1, Nox4 and eNOS mRNA expression were substantially enhanced in aorta of female ZDF rats compared to those in lean animals. In a conclusion, our data suggest that an elevation of superoxide and alteration of NO production may in part contribute to the predisposition of the female aorta to injury in diabetes.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1135&context=uop_etds,2014,-6.291829,-15.550106,Sex differences in aortic endothelial function of diabetic rats Possible involvement of superoxide and nitric oxide production,"Han, X."

Kehoe,"Molecular biology, Parasitology, Biological sciences, Metronidazole, Trichomonas vaginalis","Trichomonas vaginalis is a protozoan parasite responsible for causing nearly eight million cases of Trichomoniasis every year in the United States. Trichomoniasis is often an asymptomatic infection, but in some cases it does lead to mild clinical manifestions. Trichomoniasis is easily treated with a single dose of Metronidazole. Drug resistance is not common, but it is on the rise. In addition to increasing rates of drug resistance, Trichomoniasis also poses a public health threat as it has been shown to increase the risk of HIV transmission. In order to combat this emerging public health threat, we must better understand the mechanism by which metronidazole exerts its action on T. vaginalis , as well as how the parasite has responded by evolving mechanisms of drug resistance on a molecular level. In order to investigate these questions, a microarray analysis of two distinct strains of T. vaginalis , one being more virulent and slightly less metronidazole sensitive, was performed. This allowed the identification of several genes that may play a role in virulence and drug susceptibility. Once these genes were identified, their differential regulation was further confirmed by Northern Blot analysis. One of these genes, Thioredoxin Reductase (TrxR) was then cloned and transfected into T. vaginalis . After confirming expression of the HA-tagged TrxR, the cell line was then used to determine the effect of over-expression of the gene on drug sensitivity. The metronidazole IC 50 for this cell line was compared to wild type cells. Additionally, immunostaining of the transfected cells was performed to determine the localization of the HA-tagged thioredoxin reductase. The results of this investigation provide further support for the role of TrxR in metronidazole activation as well as metronidazole sensitivity.

Phylogeographic trends are inferred from analysis of the gene Cytochrome oxidase subunit I ( CoI ). Patterns of mtDNA diversity imply historical panmixia and Mid-to-late Pliocene divergence from other Speyeria approximately xx mya. Diversification within the species appears to have occurred primarily during the Pleistocene. The data partially support a hypothesis of multiple waves of diversification following the climatic fluctuations of glacial and interglacial periods. Speyeria callippe was found to be paraphyletic containing both Speyeria egleis and Speyeria edwardsii. The genetic variation observed within S. callippe was highly structured reflecting local geography. However, this did not extend to larger scales as subspecies and major color pattern groups were not recovered as monophyletic, consistent with the large amount of overlapping morphological variation.

Methods for the system to scan user-input constraints, to choose the best sample motion and synthesize the motion sequence based on route affected by the constraint are also proposed. Each generated motion piece is blended with the default motion, and thus a motion sequence composed of several pieces of motion based on constraints will be generated.

Ludwig,"School administration, Physical education, Teacher education, Health education, Education, Athletic training, Competence, Educational competencies, Preceptor, Self-efficacy","The purpose of this research was to survey allied healthcare and medical practitioners who were approved clinical instructors (ACIs) of an accredited Athletic Training Education Program to gain insight into their self-efficacy and competence on the acute care of pulmonary injuries and illnesses category in the 5 th edition of the Athletic Training educational competencies. The conceptual framework guiding this study was grounded in the contributions of ACIs' self-efficacy beliefs and cognitive competence were evaluated to assess if the Athletic Training clinical educator are confident and knowledgeable on the new Athletic Training Competencies. Major findings of the study were that the ACIs' self-efficacy ratings were high, and the self-efficacy ratings were statistically (p < .05) beneficial to specific subcategory competence in the acute care of pulmonary injuries and illnesses. When using 70% as the minimal accepted percentage to be considered competent the ACIs' responses led to the analysis of inadequate competence in immediate emergent management (62.2%), transportation (65.2%), and education (50.2%) on the acute care of pulmonary injuries and illnesses, and there were specific Competency subcategories in which ACIs' responses led to the analysis of inadequate competence. The demographic variables, gender and years of education, had statistical relationships with the ACIs' competence on the acute care of pulmonary injuries and illnesses. In conclusion, institutions that host ATEPs, the ATEP administrators and the ATEPs' associated ACIs should use this research to note that improvisational education or spontaneous teaching are not always efficient for clinical education. Even though clinical educators have high self-efficacy on areas of professional competence, this does not translate to actual competence. So Athletic Training students may not be receiving adequate evaluation and assessment of their clinical and cognitive knowledge, which could ultimately translate into patient care and in worse care scenario, the death of a patient. So those individuals who have the most opportunity to aid in the evolution of professional knowledge have the most responsibility to cultivate more resources and more accountability to the universities, ATEPs, and ACIs.",Education,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1065&context=uop_etds,2014,9.37659,7.735978,A study on the self-efficacy and competence of approved clinical instructors on Athletic Training educational competencies,"Ludwig, C."

This research was intended to prepare high performance glass-ceramics from these three industrial by-products. What's more, two energy saving methods were put forward. One was application of single-stage heat treatment, another was mixing cold solid raw material (IOT, CFA) with melted BFS discharged at 1500 in iron making process instead of mixing all the raw material in room temperature and then heating them to melt. Different binary basicity (MCaO /MSiO2 ) and content of Al2O3 had been studied to determine the best formula for high performance glass-ceramic in terms of mechanical properties. Sample 04 (MCaO /MSiO2 =0.4, Al2O3 wt. %=9%) and Sample 05Al-2 (MCaO /MSiO2 =0.5, Al2O3 wt. %=12%) were found with the highest bending strength, 94 MPa and 89 MPa respectively.

The history of the public education has long been marked by an achievement gap between White and Asian students and students from other ethnic groups. In spite of efforts to address this issue, the gap continues to widen. Early College High Schools (ECHS's) are examples of reform models that are developed to support student achievement among undeserved groups. Without an understanding of the factors that influence student decisions to attend ECHS's and an understanding of the ways students perceive their experiences in such schools; administrators and teachers in these schools are left to more or less ""guess"" at the most effective ways to structure curriculum and instruction. A qualitative analysis was used to explore student perception and experiences. A survey asked students to share the primary factors that influenced their decision to attend NCECHS, instead of a traditional public school. Findings from this research suggest that the participant's perceived costs and benefits were based on both personal preferences and rational choices. Some aspects of the program that were especially pleasing to students included having the opportunity to earn a high school diploma, earn college credit and earn an associate's degree at the same time. Many students expressed dissatisfaction and anxiety with attending this ECHS. Frustration with the college enrollment process, prerequisites, heavy workloads, time management, fear of academic failure, relationships with instructors and disassociation from friends were also among the findings of this study.",Education,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1066&context=uop_etds,2014,12.520037,6.541863,Exploring students' decisions to attend an early college high school,"McNeil-McDaniel, A."

However, these data are limited because students are rarely able to accurately state or pour the standard serving size for various types of alcohol, rendering the validity of self-report questionable (Midanik, 1982; White et al., 2003). Moreover, students are often required to participate in university alcohol training programs; these programs are generally information-based and rarely contain a skills training component, in which students practice identifying and pouring standard servings of alcohol. Researchers have evaluated the effectiveness of nutrition and alcoholic beverage portion training procedures that make use of practice, measurement aids, and verbal feedback; however, to our knowledge, the effect of stimulus fading on a free pour procedure has not been assessed even though research suggests stimulus fading is an effective training procedure. In the current study we assessed the effects of individualized 1) verbal feedback, 2) superimposition training (i.e., measurement aids), and 3) stimulus fading training on college students' ability to accurately free pour a standard serving of beer into 18 oz training and generalization cups using an ABA and in some cases, an ABACA design.

Meyer,"Computer Engineering, Applied sciences, Biometrics, Iris categorization, Iris recognition, Symbolic features, Textons","Biometric identification uses individuals' characteristics to attempt to match a sample to a database of existing samples. An increasingly commonly used characteristic is the iris section of the eye, which is valued for its uniqueness among individuals and stability over time. One key concern with iris recognition systems is the time required to find a test sample's match in a database of subjects. This work considers methods for categorizing irises within a database, so that a search for a match to a test sample can be focused on the test sample's category. The main method for categorization used in this work is texton learning. Texton learning involves creating a vocabulary of features and determining how much of each feature a given sample has. Once images are represented by textons, they are clustered in an unsupervised process. Success of the system is assessed as its ability to take a previously unseen image from a subject and classify it the same as the database reference for the subject. This work improves upon the past applications of texton learning with more thorough experiments to determine the optimal number of textons and image clusters. This system also investigates different accuracy metrics, with this work detailing two key methods and their relative benefits. Additionally, more in depth analysis is given for potential time saving impacts for finding a database match. Beyond the improvements to texton learning, symbolic features (ethnicity and gender) have been incorporated into the categorization process using a probabilistic metric.

Multiple tools such as the cis -acting factors MATα secretion signal and MBP fusion partners, and trans-acting modifications such as the bgs mutants have increased heterologous protein secretion. Although these techniques have already been used, their effects on the protein secretory pathway have yet to be elucidated. In this study, fluorescence microscopy was used to compare the localization of proteins expressed with the mutated MATα with the deletion of amino acids 57-70 to the wild type MATα secretion signal. Additional fluorescence microscopy was completed to visualize the localization of MBP-EGFP and EGFP-MBP fusion proteins and their spatial relativity to organelle markers. EGFP-MBP was used to further distinguish the properties of multiple bgs mutants. Additionally, secreted lipase activity levels were evaluated in bgs13 strains expressing either the wild type or the mutated MAT&agr signal peptide. The results indicated that regardless of their differences, the MATα secretion signals and bgs mutants transported their cargo proteins through similar pathways within the cells. The results of the MBP fusion proteins suggest that the arrangement of MBP significantly influences protein secretion and localization. Lastly, the bgs13 mutant with MATα secretion signals demonstrated that lipase activity increased additively when cis- and trans -acting mutations were combined. Ultimately, these results can provide better understanding of each modified factor and the protein sorting pathway, leading to potential techniques that optimize protein secretion in P. pastoris .",Biological Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1184&context=uop_etds,2014,-17.959162,-11.909807,The effects of cis- and trans-acting mutations on recombinant protein secretion in Pichia pastoris,"Moua, P."

The relationships of categorical social structure and community organization factors with personal and property crimes were studied using analysis of variance. The results demonstrated that most of the social structure and community organization variables did not have a statistically significant relationship with personal or property crimes. However, the percentage of students receiving general financial aid in the form of Pell Grants demonstrated a strong relationship with an increase in both personal and property crimes. Additionally, an increase in the ratio of part-time to full-time faculty members demonstrated an increase in property crime on campus. The findings indicate that students on campuses with a high percentage of Pell Grant recipients are likely to be impacted by crime in some manner and that campuses with a large percentage of Pell Grant recipients need to consider additional supports and interventions to protect students from crime on campus.

This thesis brings together some of the current studies on intercultural communication in regards to the tourism industry, perceived community attitudes towards tourism, and host-guest relationships in the tourism context. Two groups of Dominicans were studied, those who worked in the tourism industry and those who did not, teachers, respectively. Data was extracted from collected questionnaires and interviews which revealed positive attitudes towards tourism, interest in expanding tourism, and various positive stereotypes towards tourists and about Dominicans themselves. In conclusion, the results were consistent with past research and include present recommendations on how to make the Dominican tourism sector even more receptive to the importance of intercultural communication.",Other,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1252&context=uop_etds,2014,9.587009,13.025928,Perceived intercultural impacts of tourism in the Dominican Republic A rural host community perspective,"Stemmerman, C."

Saraf,"Pharmacy sciences, Nanotechnology, Applied sciences, Health and environmental sciences, Amphiphiles, Cancer targeting, Integrin, Micelles, Paclitaxel, RGD","Specific interactions of ligands with receptors is one of the approaches for active targeting of anticancer drugs to cancer cells. Over expression of integrin receptors is a physiological manifestation in several cancers and is associated with cancer progression and metastasis, which makes it an attractive target for cancer chemotherapy. The peptide sequence for this integrin recognition is the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD). Self-assembly offers a unique way of presenting ligands to target receptors for recognition and binding. This study focuses on development of integrin specific peptide amphiphile self-assemblies as carriers for targeted delivery of paclitaxel to α v β 3 integrin overexpressing cancers. Amphiphiles composed of conjugates of different analogs of RGD (linear, cyclic or glycosylated) and aliphatic fatty acid with or without 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid (ADA) as linker were synthesized and characterized. The amphiphiles exhibited Critical Micellar Concentration in the range of 7-30 μM. Transmission electron microscopy images revealed the formation of spherical micelles in the size range of 10-40 nm. Forster Resonance Energy Transfer studies revealed entrapment of hydrophobic dyes within a tight micellar core and provided information regarding the cargo exchange within micelles. The RGD micelles exhibited competitive binding with 55% displacement of a bound fluorescent probe by the cyclic RGD micelles. The internalization of fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC) loaded RGD micelles was significantly higher in A2058 melanoma cells compared to free FITC within 20 minutes of incubation at 37°C. The same micelles showed significantly lower internalization at 4°C and on pretreatment with 0.45M sucrose confirming endocytotic uptake of the RGD micellar carriers. The IC50 of paclitaxel in A2058 melanoma cells was lower when treated within RGD micelles as compared to treatment of free drug. On the other hand, IC50 values increased by 2 to 9 fold for micellar treatment in comparison to free drug in Detroit 551 cells. In A2058 melanoma xenograft mice model, the Paclitaxel-RGD micelles exhibited a significant inhibition of tumor growth in comparison to control treatment for both alternate day and twice weekly treatments. The studies showed the feasibility of using the non covalent peptide based self-assemblies as vehicles for targeted delivery in cancer.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1136&context=uop_etds,2014,-19.391066,-10.409967,RGD based peptide amphiphiles as drug carriers for cancer targeting,"Saraf, P."

Correlations and multiples regressions were the primary quantitative methods used to determine which prerequisites were most likely to predict passing the NPTE. Demographic information of ethnicity and age, did not show any significant correlation with score on the NPTE-PTA. Further analysis determined that both anatomy and overall grade point average had statistical correlations. However, overall college grade point average was the only variable that contributed significantly to the NPTE score. Therefore, overall grade point average was used to develop a predictive admission formula that can be used for further research and analysis. The procedures for this pilot study can be used to duplicate the study on a larger scale and continue to build a predictive admission formula that has the potential for establishing a consistent admission criterion for PTA programs.

Smoking research from a respondent learning paradigm focuses on the role of environmental stimuli that function as elicitors of physiological responses related to smoking. Basic research suggests that compensatory responses may play a role in drug tolerance and relapse. In one preliminary study assessing the role of compensatory responses to smoking stimuli (Machado, 2011), drops in carbon monoxide (CO) were observed only when smokers viewed smoking related stimuli. However, it is possible that these patterns were influenced by CO monitor sensitivity to differing exhalation durations in which exhalation duration may have been under stimulus control of the smoking stimuli. The purpose of the current study was twofold: Study 1 controlled for exhalation duration by holding exhalation duration constant using a within subject design and Study 2 precisely measured but did not control total exhalation duration in an attempt to replicate the results from Machado (2011).

Here, breast cancer cells, with elevated endogenous AKT or overexpression of activated AKT exhibited tamoxifen-stimulated cell proliferation and enhanced cell motility. To gain mechanistic insight on AKT-induced endocrine resistance, gene expression profiling was performed to determine the transcripts that are differentially expressed post-tamoxifen therapy under conditions of AKT overexpression. Consistent with the biological outcome, many of these transcripts function in cell proliferation and cell motility networks and were quantitatively validated in a larger panel of breast cancer cells. Moreover, ribonucleotide reductase M2 (RRM2) was revealed as a key contributor to AKT-induced tamoxifen resistance. Inhibition of RRM2 by RNAi-mediated approaches significantly reversed the tamoxifen-resistant cell growth, inhibited cell motility, and activated pro-apoptotic pathways. In addition, treatment of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells with the small molecule RRM2 inhibitor Didox significantly reduced cell growth in vitro and in vivo. To further establish a functional association between RRM2 expression and tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells, gain of function studies were performed by overexpressing RRM2 in MCF-7 cells. Overexpression of RRM2 profoundly reduced tamoxifen sensitivity and down-regulated ER-&agr in otherwise tamoxifen sensitive breast cancer cells. Furthermore, breast cancer cells with high RRM2 had elevated Her-2 and EGFR expression, modulated ER-&agr signaling and NFκB expression. These findings also indicate that it may be possible to use RRM2 as a prognostic factor in breast cancer patients under tamoxifen therapy, and can be considered a potential therapeutic target in tumors that have acquired resistance to tamoxifen. Finally, inhibition of RRM2 by drug Didox effectively eradicates the tamoxifen resistant population, revealing a potential beneficial effect of combination therapy that includes RRM2 inhibition to delay or abrogate tamoxifen resistance. In conclusion, the findings of this work delineate the important role of RRM2 in Akt induced and acquired tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer. It also provides a preclinical rationale for evaluating tamoxifen in combination with Didox for breast cancer treatment.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1137&context=uop_etds,2014,-21.874582,-8.576613,Mechanism of tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer,"Shah, K."

Sloan,"Environmental education, Elementary education, Education, Curriculum, Environment, Garden-based learning, Interdisciplinary, Place-based learning, Project-based learning","Teachers in elementary schools have increasingly been required to follow pacing guides, given directives on what curriculum to use, and are provided standardized assessments to measure student learning. Curricula used by elementary teachers rarely address the environmental degradation plaguing the planet. School gardens have been used for over a century by educators as a place to promote students learning about the environment, science, and health. However, few studies have been conducted exploring the ways teachers have been influenced by teaching within school gardens. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to better understand the role of school gardens as a learning place, while exploring the lived experiences of teachers' interactions and experiences within school gardens and ways place-based education influenced teachers' pedagogical approaches and curriculum decisions. The four participants who took part in this study were all elementary school teachers at a Central California school. The guiding research question was stated as: How do school gardens function as learning places? Phenomenological methodology was used to explore the shared experiences teachers had with utilizing the school garden as a learning place. From analysis of interviews, classroom and garden observations, and supplemental curricula used by participants, three themes emerged illuminating ways participants' pedagogy and curriculum decisions had been influenced. Interactions and experiences with school gardens inspired participants to integrate project-based learning and interdisciplinary supplemental curriculum into their lessons. Place-based learning helped to build relationships, and the importance of teachers integrating emotional connections in their instructional practices. By teaching content disciplines using interdisciplinary curricula with lessons taught in the school garden, participants were able to integrate project-based learning activities that increased student responsibilities in the learning process and provided service learning opportunities. Conclusions drawn from the findings were that direct interactions and experiences with elements of place-based learning in a school garden influenced the ways in which participants perceived the purpose of their pedagogical approaches and curriculum decisions. Literature supported these findings and reinforced the influence of lessons in school gardens promoting environmental and health education.

Parent performance during the role-play assessments was compared to parent performance during parent-child interactions. Experiment 1 of this study included role- 6 play assessments for the IY program in a multiple-baseline design across 6 skills with pre and post parent-child interactions. Participants were 7 parents with children between the ages of 2 and 8 years. The parent-child interactions were also scored using the Dyadic Parent Interaction Coding System (DPICS). The effectiveness of the role-play assessments as a measure of skill acquisition as demonstrated by an increase in scores only after the skill is formally taught in the program, and similarity between behavior during the role-play assessments and behavior during the parent-child interactions, was not possible due to lack of data and participant attrition. Using a repeated measures design, Experiment 2 addressed limitations of Experiment 1 by utilizing 4 participants with no involvement in the IY program. Role-play assessments and parent-child interactions were conducted 5 times (1 time per week) with 1 training session for the skill area with the lowest scores across the first 3 baseline sessions during the 41 h observation. Results demonstrated differences between parent behavior with an adult role-player compared to their child with variable responding in both the child and structured and role-play assessments during baseline. Increases were observed during both post-training sessions with increases in the final session for the parent-child interactions for the selected skill area for 3 of the 4 participants.

The enhancement of bioavailability with a use of nanoemulsion has often been reported empirically and speculated to be a result of the enhanced dissolution due to a larger surface area, however, the mechanism of nanoemulsion permeation was yet to be explored. The goal of this dissertation was to understand the mechanism of nanoemulsion permeation and to control permeation and bioavailability. The first objective was to delineate the effect of thermodynamic activities of the drug in nanoemulsion on the permeation through a barrier. The flux from nanoemulsion depended on the thermodynamic activities of both ionized and unionized species in the aqueous phase of nanoemulsion. A simple nanoemulsion was not favorable to enhance the permeation over the saturated solution due to the reduced thermodynamic activity. Thus, the second objective was to elucidate the role of transient supersaturation on permeation enhancement using nanoemulsion. In vitro permeation using self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS) was enhanced over the saturated solution due to the transient supersaturation; however the enhancement of bioavailability in rats was not due to the enhanced passive permeation. Therefore there was a need to increase or prolong the supersaturation. The third objective was to control the supersaturation to enhance in vitro permeation by formulation approaches. The optimum drug loading was determined based on the precipitation kinetics; however the ability to modulate the thermodynamic activity to enhance permeation by changing the drug loading was limited. The precipitation inhibitor, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose was able to retard the precipitation and enhanced in vitro permeation due to the increased thermodynamic activity. The significance of this work was the systematic approach to understand the mechanism of nanoemulsion absorption and to utilize nanoemulsion for permeation enhancement. The knowledge gained in this work will help rationally design the formulation in the future.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1138&context=uop_etds,2014,-15.109759,-7.1328845,Mechanistic study of nanoemulsion absorption and its application for permeation enhancement,"Stowell, Y."

One method to reduce search time is to predict an individual's ethnicity and then only search iris templates belonging to that particular ethnicity in the database. By limiting the search to a small subsection of the database, as opposed to an exhaustive search, this method will cut significant run time from the search process. We propose the use of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system to implement this idea. In addition to the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, we also used the subtractive clustering technique to create membership functions that helped us compare how each iris' texture features were clustered. By combining subtractive clustering with the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, we were able to map each user to a singular value that identified with a specific ethnicity based on their iris characteristic features.

Research findings demonstrated that demographic characteristics like socioeconomic status( SES), parents' gender and employment influenced parental reading beliefs significantly (p < .001); home literacy environments, children's reading interests, children's development both in literacy and cognition were closely related with parental reading beliefs (p < .001); although both parents' beliefs influence home literacy practices, mothers' beliefs played a more significant role in creating home literacy environments; the association of parental reading beliefs with children's reading interests and between parental reading beliefs and literacy development were mediated by home literacy practices; and the associations of parental reading beliefs with children's literacy and between cognition were mediated by children's reading interest.

This relationship may have significant impact on health-related physical fitness and help to address the exercise behavior deficit in the US. However, it is not known if self-belief about exercise significantly impacts physical fitness levels. The purpose of this study was to identify self-beliefs about exercise and determine if these beliefs influence behaviors and result in greater levels of physical fitness. Exercise self-schema theory is a social cognitive psychological theory that is uniquely capable at explaining and predicting chronic exercise behaviors. It posits that established self-images are based on cognitive generalizations about the ""self"" creates a very powerful and prevailing impetus to behave in ways that correspond with established self-images. Preliminary research has found self-images (also called self-schemas) concerning exercise to more reliably predict both exercise intention and reported exercise behavior better than beliefs concerning exercise alone. In the present study we sought to evaluate whether exercise self-schema theory could differentiate levels of health-related physical fitness in college students. We also included gender as an independent variable to investigate gender-specific behavioral predictability of the theory. The results of this study revealed a significant link between exercise self-schema classification and indices of health-related physical fitness. This link existed independent of gender. In this study exerciser schematics were found to be significantly more physically fit, leaner, and to exercise at significantly greater frequency than individuals not classified as exerciser schematics. These findings provide preliminary evidence that exerciser self-schema is positively associated with increased physical fitness.

The relevance of these conditions to biological systems has garnered attention for PNIPAM-based polymer as potential biomedical materials. Candidate transition metal monomers containing ruthenium and nickel cores were designed and synthesized for copolymerization with NIPAM and cross-linker methylene-bis-acrylamide in order to attain metallopolymer microspheres with a high percentage of metal incorporation. Synthesis of 4-vinyl-4'-methyl-2,2'-bipyridine (vmbpy) was optimized from literature procedures for usage in the metal-containing monomers. Metal-containing monomers were then synthesized, purified, and characterized using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H-NMR), X-ray diffraction, Ultraviolet-Visible light (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, and spectrofluorometry. While the Ru complex was pure and exhibited interesting photochemical properties, lability of the ligands on the Ni monomers resulted in complication of their synthesis. Polymer microspheres of poly(NIPAM-co-vmbpy), the cross-linked copolymer constructed from NIPAM and vmbpy monomers, were synthesized from modified emulsion polymerization procedures. Experimental setup parameters and conditions—such as the methods of injection of initiator and stirring, the time duration for incubating the emulsion, and the initiation temperature—were varied to assess their influences on the material properties of the final product. The polymers were tested for size and morphological uniformity by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). While varying the method of initiator injection had no measurable effect on the product, strong mechanical stirring and incubation of the polymer emulsion for 15-25 minutes at 71 °C procured similar polymer products. Consistent properties ensured the polymers' suitability for further material development.

However, both experimental and theoretical studies have not given a clear explanation on the roles of each metal in the reactivities, largely due to the limited number of available bimetallic species. To study the system systematically, we set our goal to synthesize bimetallic complexes from two independent approaches. In the first approach, five N, N’ -diarylformamidines with symmetric or asymmetric substituents on the phenyl groups were synthesized and fully characterized. Formamidines without bulky substituents exhibited fluxionality in solution, which was proved by a single set of signal in 1 H NMR. In contrast, two sets of signals were observed for formamidines with bulky substituents in the ortho positions, indicating two major stereoisomers ( E and Z conformers) co-existing in solution. In solid state, strong stability for E conformers was gained from a pair of H bonds between two ligands facing each other. The phenomenon was observed for all ligands but N, N’ -bis(2,6-dimethylphenyl)formamidine ( L2 ), in which ligands in Z conformation were connected through H bonds from both sides of a ligand and an infinite chain structure formed in solid state. Metallation of the formamidines with diethylzinc and mesitylmagnesium bromide produced ten complexes in a variety of geometries, indicating a rich diversity in geometry for the formamidine family as coordination ligands. Among these complexes, three bimetallic complexes, with metal atoms close in distance, are potential candidates for the formation of complexes with metal-metal bonds. In each dizinc complex, two formamidinates (deprotonated formamidines) spanned over the two Zn atoms and brought them together, while in the dimagnesium complex, the two Mg atoms were bridged by two bromides, resulting in a Mg 2 Br 2 cubic core. In the other approach, two newly designed tripodal ligands were obtained at relatively high yields. Each of the ligands contains three branches built up from a central atom C or N. Lone pairs on the three branches of a deprotonated ligand working together could behave like a three-prong clamp and secure two metal centers closely in the pocket. A dichromium complex with a geometry matching our initial design was successfully synthesized.

The mutants exhibited an unusual ability to supersecrete beta-galactosidase, due to the effects of a randomly disrupted gene by pREMI-Z. To learn more about the novel effects of the gene disruption, nine beta-galactosidase supersecreters ( bgs ) have been characterized for their phenotypes such as growth rate, cell wall integrity, and ability to produce and secrete various types of recombinant proteins. The mutants showed various population doubling times, which ranged from 1.7 to 2.4 hours. Generally, the mutants with severely diminished growth rates had much lower secretion of the reporter proteins. The mutants also showed different levels of cell wall (osmotic) defect, indicated by moderate to severe leakage of alkaline phosphatase from the vacuole. It was revealed that the cell wall defect was not necessarily associated with increased protein secretion, which suggests that the cell wall may not be a limiting barrier for the secretion of most reporter proteins. The result of the reporter study suggests that the secretion phenotypes of bgs mutants were protein specific and likely to be dependent upon the structure of the secreted protein rather than the size.",Biological Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1187&context=uop_etds,2014,-22.03699,-11.654307,Characterizing phenotypes of Pichia pastoris mutants that show enhanced secretion of recombinant proteins,"Weaver, J."

A recent report from the US Department of Education indicates that only 59% of students graduate from high school, and only 29% of high school graduates successfully complete college. Failure of students to enroll in college and the tendency of students to enroll but fail to complete college can be attributed to a lack of college readiness resources. This begs the following question: is high school too late to begin thinking about college? The purpose of this study is to explore the affect of attending a college awareness program for middle school students during the summer prior to entering high school and the impact it has on students’ use of social capital in high school and expectations for attending college. A multiple case study was employed to examine how students use social capital in their freshman year of high school as a result of attending a college awareness program.

We generated three N-terminal deletion constructs of the human AhR of 12-24 KDa in size—namely D1 (aa 84-295), D2 (aa 84-192) and D3 (aa 191-295)—to suppress the Arnt function. We observed that all three constructs interact with the human Arnt with similar affinities. D2, which contains part of the AhR PAS-A domain and interacts with the PAS-A domain of Arnt, inhibits the formation of the AhR gel shift complex. D2 suppresses the 3-methylcholanthrene-induced, dioxin response element (DRE)-driven luciferase activity in Hep3B cells and exogenous Arnt reverses this D2 suppression. D2 suppresses the induction of CYP1A1 at both the message and protein levels in Hep3B cells; however, the CYP1B1 induction is not affected. D2 suppresses the recruitment of Arnt to the cyp1a1 promoter but not to the cyp1b1 promoter, partly because the AhR/Arnt heterodimer binds better to the cyp1b1 DRE than to the cyp1a1 DRE. Interestingly, D2 has no effect on the cobalt chloride-induced, hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1)-dependent expression of vegf, aldolase c, and ldh-a messages. Our data reveal that the flanking sequences of the DRE contribute to the binding affinity of the AhR/Arnt heterodimer to its endogenous enhancers and the function of AhR and HIF-1 can be differentially suppressed by the D2 inhibitory molecule. In chapter 2, a Pichia Pastoris expression system was constructed expressing codon optimized human full length AhR. This codon optimization is necessary for overexpression of huAhR. RT-PCR data showed that the codon optimized mRNA was more stably expressed than wild types. Overexpressed huAhR protein was degraded by proteinase when using a regular P. Pastoris strain yJC100 whereas the proteinase deficient ySMD1163 maintained a much higher level of huAhR. P. Pastoris expressed huAhR was natively purified and analyzed. Coimmunopricipitation assay shows its interaction with endogenous Arnt. A ligand-dependent gel shift was also observed. In addition, we performed an in vitro coprecipitation assay to study its binding to endogenous cyp1b1 DREs. The result shows that the DRE3, known as a critical DRE for cyp1b1 transcriptional activity, has the highest binding affinity to AhR/Arnt complex. Taking together, we constructed a novel P. Pastoris expression system to overexpress human full length AhR. Purified huAhR is a good reagent for studing its ligand and DNA binding. In chapter 3, an adeno-associated virus (AAV) expression system was constructed to express an AhR deletion contruct CΔ553 (aa1-295) for tumor injection.

Hence, G-quadruplex DNA has recently become a promising target in oncology. The formation of G-quadruplex structures is greatly facilitated by G-quadruplex binding ligands such as Thiazole orange (TO). Compared with other G-quadruplex binding ligands, TO has an intriguing tunable fluorescence property. Upon binding to DNA, the fluorescence of TO can increase up to 1000-fold, making it an attractive probe for studying ligand-DNA interactions. However, the poor binding affinity and minimal binding selectivity towards different DNA conformations greatly limit its applications. My research focuses on developing G-quadruplex binding ligands using TO as a scaffold. In the first part of this work, we investigated the feasibility of increasing the TO binding affinity and selectivity toward G-quadruplex DNA by introducing side chains to the molecule. TO derivatives containing various side chains were successfully synthesized and characterized. Biophysical and biochemical studies with duplex and G-quadruplex DNA showed that tethering side chains to TO is an effective approach to tune its ability of binding to duplex or G-quadruplex DNA. Possible binding modes of the effective derivatives were studied using AutoDock. Their inhibition of telomerase activities was studied using the TRAP assay. The cytotoxicity of these derivatives toward three cancer cell lines was also investigated using the MTS assay. The second part of this work focuses on development of TO-based G-quadruplex DNA binding ligands that can bind to DNA via the dual recognition mode. TO was tethered with pyrene, naphthalene diimide, and anthraquinone respectively to yield three novel conjugates. Further investigation suggested that the conjugate of TO with naphthalene diimide (TO-NF) gave the best G-quadruplex binding affinity.

This paper investigated the role of cysteine protease 4 (CP4) in T. vaginalis through characterization and expression of CP4. T. vaginalis strains showed differential protein and mRNA expression, although it was unclear which CP4 variants (other than TVAG_355480 and TVAG_467970) were recognized by the CP4 antibody for the protein studies. Iron did not regulate expression of TVAG_355480 and TVAG_467970 at the transcriptional but possibly at the post-transcriptional level. Our results also suggested that processing of recombinant TVAG_467970 occurred through cleavage by proteins rather than autocatalytic processing. Finally, endogenous CP4 was localized to vesicles though it was unclear which CP4 variant was recognized and was co-localized with HA-tagged VAMP1/2. Localization of HA-tagged TVAG_467970 proved problematic when co-staining with anti-HA and anti-CP4, so further localization studies need to be optimized. This paper also examined the role of iron superoxide dismutase 6 (TvFeSOD6) in resistance to metronidazole, the current drug used for Trichomoniasis infections. Of the two types of resistance, aerobic resistance may occur due to a high concentration of intracellular oxygen which can outcompete metronidazole for electrons or can re-oxidize reduced metronidazole to its inactive form. We determined that there was differential expression of TvFeSODs in T. vaginalis strains with varying levels of resistance although this may not correlate with the degree of resistance. Our results also showed that an increase in ectopic TvFeSOD6 in MSA1121 led to an augmentation in SOD activity and in resistance under aerobic conditions due to the possible role of TvFeSOD6 in also contributing to a higher intracellular oxygen concentration in MSA1121 (which is already sensitive to oxygen), leading to an increase in resistance.",Biological Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1188&context=uop_etds,2014,-17.324955,-13.08123,The characterization of cysteine protease 4 and superoxide dismutase 6 in Trichomonas vaginalis,"Yelpaala, Y."

We have used the neuronal cell line NG115-401L with unique calcium signaling characteristics to test the hypothesis that improving calcium loading into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to increase ER calcium levels acts as a possible neuroprotective response. We approached this problem using both pharmacological and genetic approaches targeting the central mediator of calcium uptake in the ER localized sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase (SERCA) enzyme. The pharmacological studies involved use of the ginger root compound 6-gingerol, which to date is the best documented agent for activating SERCA enzymes in heart and skeletal muscle. However, in our experiments, gingerol did not appear to activate NG115-401L SERCA pumps; indeed, the compound produced a response more like that of a SERCA inhibitor inducing a rapid ER calcium depletion. In addition, gingerol stimulated robust calcium influx responses, an unexpected result given the NG115-401L neural cell line is uniquely deficient in calcium influx pathways. Our genetic approach involved expressing the stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) protein in the NG115-401L cell, which is also an ER localized protein that serves as a pivotal calcium influx channel regulator. NG115-40lL neurons present a native deficiency of STIM1 expression in a background phenotype with well characterized perturbations in ER calcium regulation and control of calcium influx pathways. Thus, STIM1 may be predicted to increase ER calcium levels, conferring protection against neuron cell death due to ER calcium store defects. STIM1 expression reconstituted the corrupted calcium influx pathway in NG115-401L neurons, which conferred neuroprotective responses to ER calcium perturbation, mitochondrial oxidative stress and subsequent cell death. Our results argue for unique and undiscovered regulatory effects of gingerol on the ER calcium circulation system, and suggest that the expression of STIM1 in these neurons protects against ER stress and oxidative stress via reconstruction of cellular calcium homeostasis.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1141&context=uop_etds,2014,-17.897633,-13.055367,Investigation of the endoplsmic reticulum calcium stores for their potential roles in neuroprotection using the NG115-401L neuronal cell line model,"Zhang, C."

Although major ethical challenges make it nearly impossible to invasively and directly measure serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) levels in human brains, neuroimaging technologies have shown macroscopic structural and functional abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of depressed patients. The monoamine hypothesis of depression is based on the neurotransmitter imbalance, such as deceased serotonin brain levels are implicated in the cause of depression. Research has focused on the control mechanisms involved in the dorsal raphé nucleus (DRN) which is the serotonergic control center located in the midbrain. We hypothesized that activation 5-HT 2A receptor in PFC would increase serotonin levels by an AMPA-dependent mechanism in both DRN and PFC. Enhancement of the 5-HT in DRN may inhibit 5-HT level in PFC by 5-HT 1A receptor. This becomes the full feedback loop system. While 5-HT levels in the PFC have been well studied, pathway that modulate this DRN pool through upstream cascade interactions leading to a downstream feedback loop have been difficult to elucidate. Developing a mechanism-based pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) model to quantitatively describe the effect of 5-HT 2A receptors regulation to serotonin in the DRN and PFC would help us to better understand the complex brain. 5-HT 2A receptor agonist and AMPA receptor agonist and antagonist were used to activate or block the related receptor. Male Wistar rats underwent neurosurgery for implantation of microdialysis (MD) probes. Three to five rats were randomly assigned to experimental arms. Using the MD method, the drug combination was examined to explore the drug effect on time course of 5-HT release in DRN and PFC. Based on the experiment results, a mechanism-based PD model was developed. Phoenix WinNonlin ® and Berkeley Madonna™ were used for model estimation, external validation with secondary data set, and simulation. The result supports the possibility of a 5-HT 2A /AMPA feedback control circuit that originates in the PFC and modulates DRN and PFC 5-HT levels through feedback coupling of 5-HT. The time-course profiles of 5-HT in both DRN and PFC was well modeled and model parameters were estimated with good precision (CV% ranged from 1.37% to 35.03%).

Some of the experiments were carried out on the laboratory-based Threshold PEPICO (TPEPICO) apparatus which has the advantage of having a low-temperature inlet system and unlimited measurement time, while most of the projects involved the use of the Imaging PEPICO (iPEPICO) apparatus at the Swiss Light Source, which is capable to determine ionic dissociation energies to sub-kJ/mol accuracy. The iPEPICO on the synchrotron beamline was also useful where measurements required energies in excess of 14 eV. The modeling framework of PEPICO is based on the RRKM statistical theory of dissociation kinetics and statistical energy distributions and models complex dissociation pathways to extract both kinetics and thermochemical data from the experiment. In the first project, we measured the onsets of Br- and I-loss reactions for C 2 H 5 Br and C 2 H 5 I using TPEPICO, respectively. The heats of formations of the two molecules are related through the ethyl cation, which was used in their determination. The second project involved measuring Cl-loss from four S i O j Cl k compounds viz. SCl 2 , S 2 Cl 2 , SOCl 2 , and SO 2 Cl 2 to obtain reliable thermochemistry. The second Cl-loss from S 2 Cl 2 + and SOCl 2 + helped us conclude that assuming three-dimensional translational degrees of freedom yields a more reliable statistical model of product-energy distributions. The third project investigated methanol and its isotopologues to explore the dissociation pathways through the H/D-losses. The 0 K appearance energies were used to determine the accurate heat of formation of CH 2 OH and the proton affinity of formaldehyde.

Although P. pastoris is a popular host organism, secretion inefficiency continues to be a major hurdle in its ability to produce high levels of foreign protein. Optimization of cis- and trans-acting factors has greatly enhanced the secretory capabilities of P. pastoris, however protein-specific engineering of a host organism is costly and not always effective. P. pastoris' secretion inefficiency is commonly due to trans-acting factors. Strains of S. cerevisiae have been engineered, through random genomic mutation, that are capable of overcoming these /ram-acting factors to secrete high levels of foreign protein. The Lin-Cereghino laboratory at University of the Pacific has developed a screen to identify mutations in P. pastoris capable of circumventing secretion obstacles. The P. pastoris genome was randomly disrupted through restriction enzyme-mediated integration of an antibiotic resistance marker. Supersecretion mutants were identified by their ability to secrete β-galactosidase, a reporter enzyme not natively secreted by P. pastoris.

This property of guanine has also been utilized for the development of several anticancer agents including the well-known platinum complexes, cisplatin and carboplatin. The two closely related nickel complexes, NiCR and NiCR-2H, exhibit significant differences in cytotoxicity towards MCF-7 cancer cells. In the first part of this work, we explain this difference using biochemical and biophysical approaches to study their interactions with duplex DNA. The nickel complexes were found to selectively oxidize guanines in bulged DNA structures in the presence of oxidant and notably NiCR-2H oxidizes guanines more efficiently than NiCR. According to 1 H NMR studies, NiCR-2H binds strongly to the N7 position of dGMP compared to NiCR and could be an important oxidation product of NiCR under physiological conditions. The second part of this work focuses on the secondary DNA structures known as G-quadruplex formed in the guanine rich telomeric region. G-quadruplex is formed by stacking of G-quartets (a coplanar cyclic array of four Gs) on top of each other. Its formation is known to inhibit the activity of the reverse transcriptase telomerase that is overexpressed in 80-90% cancer cells. The guanines in telomeric DNA are readily oxidized due to their low redox potential and the major oxidation product is 7, 8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (OxodG). OxodG (0.58 V vs. NHE) can further be oxidized in the presence of one electron oxidants and the resulting product forms adducts with endogenous nucleophiles such as spermine. In light of these findings, we hereby designed and synthesized novel bifunctional perylene derivatives that can selectively bind to the telomeric DNA via G-quadruplex formation and subsequently react with OxodG in close proximity.

It did not take long because it was delivered to the Pacific Mass Spectrometry Facility in August 2006 and I was able to being using and learning the technique. The ion source creates excited state helium metastables (2 3 S) with an ionization potential of 19.8 eV are created by a glow discharge at atmospheric pressure. The metastables are sent through an optional heater, to aid in desorption, enter the open-air to directly ionize your sample or ionize reagent species to react with the analyte molecules. The most observed ionization mechanism is the formation of protonated molecules from a proton-transfer reaction between the analyte and protonated water clusters. The limited to no sample preparation with the ""soft"" ionization provide very quick identification of intact organic ions in or on various types of matrices. When the DART is coupled to a high resolving power instrument, such as the JEOL AccuTOF, accurate masses and accurate isotope ratios are assigned to aid in the determination of unknown elemental compositions. This research discusses the formation of the metastable species and how they are used to produce analyte and reagent ions within the open-air sample gap of the DART-mass spectrometer interface. A description of the fundamentals on the operation including real time visualization of the fluid dynamics and confirmation of the formation of a hydroxyl radical in the proposed formation of the protonated water clusters, along with applications developed in the Pacific Mass Spectrometry Facility will also be discussed.

Dorin,"Striped bass United States, Salmon, Chinook salmon, Sonar","Since 1995, California State Fish Hatcheries (Feather River, Nimbus, and Mokelumne) and Coleman National Fish Hatchery have raised approximately 29 million 4 fall run Central Valley Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) per season for stock enhancement. From April through June, fish are acclimated in net-pens prior to release at one of three sites: the Carquinez Strait at Conoco Phillips (CP), the mouth of the Napa River at Mare Island (MI), and the San Joaquin River at Jersey Point (JP). Striped Bass, Marone saxatilis, are known to congregate at the release location to feed on the hatchery fish as they enter the Delta and Bay, and are suspected to be reducing numbers of Chinook recruitment. Dual-Frequency Identification Sonar (DIDSON) was used to capture video-like images to enumerate and estimate sizes of potential predators in the area. Stomach analysis was used to obtain consumption rate data and a simple model was used to estimate predator impacts on the hatchery fish. Data was collected in 2011 and 2012. In 2011 the striped bass population at CP was significantly larger than MI (p=0.009) and JP (p=0.038) and in 2011 , and MI (p=0.046) in 2012. Predators were significantly smaller (range 11.8-61.7 em, mean 34.6 em in 2011 ; 21-67 em, 42.9 in 2012) atJP (p<0.001). Average size predator at MI was 47.3 em (range 31-59 em) in 2011 and 50.9 em (range 33-73 em) in 20 12; and at CP was 48.3 em (range 16-77 em) in 2011 and 52.7 em (range 31-78 em) in 2012. On average an estimated 2.2% of hatchery fi sh are consumed each year by striped bass and predator impacts are greatest at CP (p<0.001).

The study was driven by three questions: 1) Does a correlation exist between ATs' perceptions of the quality of the coach-AT relationship and total job satisfaction? 2) Will either the direct or the meta-perspective held by the AT be significant predictors of overall job satisfaction? and 3) Will ATs' assumed similarity be a significant predictor of overall job satisfaction? In order to examine this issue, ATs assigned to NCAA division I institution's baseball or softball team were given a compendium survey. The survey was composed of the Job Satisfaction Survey (Spector, 1994), a modified Coach-Athlete Relationship Questionnaire (CART-Q) (Jowett & Ntoumanis, 2004), and a modified meta Coach-Athlete Relationship Questionnaire (meta CART-Q). The surveys measured ATs' total job satisfaction.and satisfaction with various job sub factors, and their direct and meta-perspectives of their relationship with their coach, respectively. Correlational and regression analyses were used to determine the influence and predictability of aspects of a quality relationship to total job satisfaction. The findings demonstrate that ATs' perception of the quality of certain aspects of their relationship with a head coach is related to overall job satisfaction. This indicates that greater efforts need to be taken to improve overall coach-AT relationship dynamics. Improving the dynamics is needed to improve conditions that can cause unacceptably low levels of job satisfaction, which lead to burnout and attrition. The quality of the coach-AT relationship and its impact on Job satisfaction needs to be recognized as a contributing factor to AT job satisfaction.

First, we designed a lipid-hydrazone-PEG conjugate that removes the PEG coating at acidic pH as in the tumor interstitium. However, such a conjugate was highly unstable on shelf. Second we developed lipids with imidazole headgroups. Such lipids can protonate to provide positive charges on liposome surface at lowered pH. Additionally, negatively charged PEGylated phospholipids can cluster with the protonated imidazole lipids to display excess positive charges on the surface of the liposomes, thus enhancing their interaction with negatively charged cancer cells. We prepared convertible liposome formulations I, II and III consisting of one of the three imidazole-based lipids DHI, DHMI and DHDMI with estimated pKa values of 5.53, 6.2 and 6.75, respectively. Zeta potential measurement confirmed the increase of positive surface charge of such liposomes at lowered pHs.

This study examined the effect of instructors' content knowledge (subject matter degree) on the results of the students' evaluations of teaching effectiveness (SETE) at a private for-profit junior college. The study employed an ex post facto causal-comparative research design. The data were analyzed through a hierarchical multiple linear regression in order to determine how much of the variance in students' responses on their evaluations of teacher effectiveness was accounted for by the instructors' content knowledge after controlling for gender, course experience, formal training in education and/or instruction, and time of day (session). The questions were categorized into four subscales using Shulman's Model of Pedagogical Reasoning and Action: comprehension, transformation, instruction, and evaluation. The data were then disaggregated into the following course subjects: English, math, natural science, psychology, and sociology. Results of the analyses suggest that instructors' content knowledge may have a negative effect on SETE results for the subscale evaluation. No effect of content knowledge was found on SETE data in the areas of comprehension, transformation, or instruction. The data suggest that the control variable of morning session has a negative effect on SETE data for the subscales comprehension, transformation, and instruction, while course experience shows evidence to suggest a positive effect within comprehension and transformation. When disaggregated by course subject matter, data suggest a negative effect of formal training on SETE results for English and psychology. Data also suggest a negative effect of morning session on sociology while course experience had a positive effect.

Although these fibers out perfmm several man-made and natural biomaterials, there are cha llenges to be circumvented before commercialization. One of the silkproducing glands warranting further study is the pyrifonn gland, which produces gluelike threads functioning to cement dragline silk to substrates. We focused on the molecular properties of PySp 1, the major component of pyrifonn silk from Latrodectus hersperus, and its putative Oiiholog, PySp2, from Nephi/a clavipes. To date, there are no reports describing the secondary structure of PySp internal block repeats. Moreover, because the PySp C-terminus amino acid residues are distinct from MaSp C-terminus and the morphology of these glands is different, we hypothesized that PySp C-terminal domains form distinct secondary structures. The MaSp C-terminus has been shown to regulate the silk assembly process and whether the PySp C-terminus performs a similar function is unknown. In order to test this supposition, we used the following experimental approaches: I) we developed a series of PySp prokaryotic expression constructs carrying various block repeat modules representative of the internal iterations found within the protein chain; 2) we constructed prokaryotic expression vectors coding for the PySp C-terminal domains; 3) we expressed and purified the PySp C-terminal domains from bacteria; 4) we performed structural analyses of the purified PySp C-terminal domains using cd spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. After expression and purification of the PySp C-tennini proteins, our studies support that this domain displays a predominantly ~-sheet structure, distinctive from the NMR-determined ahelical nature of MaSp C-tennini. The difference in secondary structure implies the MA and pyriform glands use different biochemical mechanisms during fiber extrusion to control protein folding and assembly.

However, the derived absorption parameter permeability coefficient was similar in in vitro and in vivo system for caffeine: (2.10±0.22)×10 –5 , (2.06±0.47)×10 –5 ; Naproxen: (1.91±0.44)×10 –5 , (2.34±0.26)×10 –5 ; Propranolol: (2.93±0.52)×10 –5 , (3.51±0.75)×10 –5 ; Verapamil: (3.95±0.29)×10 –5 , (4.75±0.81)×10 –5 and Atenolol: (2.01±0.68)×10 –6 , (2.95±0.32)×10 –6 cm/s, respectively (p>0.05). The discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo system was hypothesized in this study to be due to the difference in thickness and role of extensive microcirculation in the two systems. Histological evaluation revealed the presence of rich vasculature 10-20 μm below the epithelium which is responsible for quick removal of drug permeating the epithelium (100-150 μm) of sublingual mucosa and reaching systemic circulation in an in vivo system. In contrast, in in vitro system the permeated drug can only be detected after crossing the excised sublingual tissue of 250±50 μm thickness. A mathematical model based on the monolayer (epithelium) and bilayer (epithelium+connective tissue) nature of the membrane representing in vivo and in vitro system, respectively demonstrated the nature of membrane to be responsible for difference in time lag but similar permeability coefficient. To be able to predict in vivo result using in vitro data, the second objective of this dissertation research was to develop a predictive pharmacokinetic model based on the established in vitro in vivo correlation (IVIVC) of sublingual absorption parameters across two systems. Predicted plasma concentration-time profiles of propranolol, verapamil, naproxen, atenolol and caffeine were found to be in good agreement with the experimental profile with the coefficient of determination of 0.85, 0.80, 0.97, 0.98 and 0.88, respectively. The applicability of the model was further evaluated by predicting in vivo performance of Zolpidem and Propranolol following sublingual administration in human beings and comparing area under the plasma concentration-time curve. Percent prediction error was 12.02% and less than 10% (4.69, 6.69, 5.02 for 1, 1.75 and 3 mg dose, respectively) for Propranolol and Zolpidem, respectively. The final objective of this dissertation was to extend the established IVIVC to other suitable animal models such as pig for assessing sublingual absorption. Histological evaluation revealed the similarity in the structure of sublingual mucosa of pig and New Zealand White rabbit. Similar transport characteristics (p>0.05) of model drugs across sublingual mucosae of two species were observed indicating the possibility of using them interchangeably. In conclusion, a rational attempt was made in this dissertation research to identify the root cause of the discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo system and establish a correlation correcting the discrepancies. The established IVIVC and predictive pharmacokinetic model will help in rationale design and development of new sublingual formulations and will be a valuable tool in the preclinical phase of early drug development stage.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1147&context=uop_etds,2013,-14.266281,-6.1247787,Sublingual drug delivery In vitro-in vivo correlation,"Kaur, N."

Therefore, development of pharmaceutical agents, which can interfere with the DNA repair pathways, may represent a novel approach to enhance the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy by reducing drug resistance. Abasic sites (AP sites) are the key intermediates in the BER pathway and promising targets for BER inhibition. In chapter 2, we report the synthesis of two small molecules specifically targeting at AP sites and the evaluation of their activity in terms of interstrand crosslinking formation. Our results show no covalent adduct is induced, which is due to the weak DNA binding affinity. In chapter 3, we try to use TFOs to deliver the interstrand crosslinking moiety to the AP site in a sequence specific manner. Two modified phosphoramidites were synthesized and incorporated into the 5' end of TFOs. The activity was evaluated by using various biophysical and biochemical experiments. The work reported in chapter 4 is focused on the G-quadruplex structure formed in the guanine rich telomeric sequence. Many studies have shown G4 ligands can induce and stabilize G-quadruplex within telomere region and inhibit the activity of telomerase that is overexpressed in 80-90% of cancer cells. Our results indicate that phenanthroline based metal complexes, Ni(Phen) 2 , have strong binding affinity and selectivity towards G-quadruplex over duplex DNA. The effect of Ni(Phen) 2 on telomerase activity and cytotoxicity towards cancer cells was also investigated. Calixarenes containing DNA building units such as nucleotides, nucleosides, and nucleobases have recently aroused much interest because of their versatile applications.

By introducing two hydrocarbon tails, multiple TACH-based lipids (flipids) have been designed and studied that are able to perform a drastic conformational flip upon protonation, loosening the stacking of hydrocarbon tails in lipid bilayers. Liposomes constructed from such flipids (fliposomes) can be disrupted by this acid-triggered conformational flip to cause a rapid release of a cargo specifically in areas of increased acidity (such as inflammation or ischemic tissues, solid tumor, and endosome pathway). A library of flipids has been built based on structural modifications of both amino headgroups and hydrophobic tails. A series of fliposomes have been constructed and their colloidal stability, capacity and pH-dependent leakage were investigated. A good correlation between the conformational switch of flipids studied by 1 H-NMR and the fliposomes' leakage indicated that the former is a cause for the latter. The obtained results showed that all the properties of fliposomes can be manipulated by selection of the amino headgroups structure and basicity, and the length and shape of hydrophobic tails, by using mixtures of different flipids or fliposomes, and by changing the content of flipids while constructing fliposomes. As a result, we prepared the pH-triggerable fliposomes with extraordinary characteristics: high stability in storage combined with instant release of their cargo in response to a weakly acidic medium. Fliposomes encapsulating the anticancer drug methotrexate (MTX) were applied to HeLa cells and demonstrated much higher cytotoxicity than the free drug and negative controls, indicating that they could conduct more efficient cellular delivery of MTX. The MTX-loaded fliposomes inhibited tumor growth in B16F1-melanoma-bearing nude mice compared to the control group, suggesting the anticancer activity of MTX delivered by pH-triggerable fliposomes in vivo.

Five human proteins with homology to Rad51 known as the Rad51 paralogs, Rad51B, Rad51C, Rad51D, XRCC2, and XRCC3, whose loss of function in cell lines leads to high chromosomal instability. Previous studies have shown Rad51C participate in two paralog protein complexes, one containing Rad51B, Rad51C, Rad51D and XRCC2 (BCDX2) and the other containing only Rad51C and XRCC3 (CX3). However, the only structural data available is the crystal structure of RecA, the bacterial homolog, the determination of the N-terminus of human Rad51 by NMR, and the crystal structure of Pyroccocus furious Rad51. Currently the Alvinlla pompejana Rad51C has been cloned, expressed and is currently being crystallized in the Tainer laboratory (UC Berkeley) since the human Rad51C protein has proven too difficult to be utilized. To test functional association of Hs Rad51B and Hs XRCC3 to Ap Rad51C. The human proteins were heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris and the other expressed in E. coli. The proteins were extracted and interaction was tested through co-immunoprecipitation. Initial results depict weak binding or an unstable interaction between Hs Rad51B and Ap Rad51C. Hs XRCC3 and Ap Rad51C interaction remains unclear and requires further testing. Additionally, we have utilized a cellular model of HNSCC to identify whether the down-regulation of Rad51 after application of VD 3 is concomitant with the down-regulation of NBS1. NBS1 is a DNA repair protein involved in both pathways of DNA double-strand break repair, non-homologous end-joining and homologous recombinational repair. It has recently been demonstrated that NBS1 binds to Rad51 aiding in its localization to sites of DNA damage. VD 3 is a potential chemopreventive agent in the treatment of head and neck cancer. For the in vitro model Rad51 and NBS1 protein were both extracted from SCC25 and MCF-7 cancer cell lines were treated with 100 nM of VD 3 . For the in vivo model hamsters cheek pouch tissue sections with VD 3 treated and DMBA over the course of 14 weeks were used. Rad51 and NBS1 staining is restricted to the nuclei of the basal cell layer of the epithelium in VD 3 treated animals as compared to untreated controls where staining is evident throughout the dysplastic epithelium and is not restricted to nuclei. Unlike the western blot data of Rad51 that shows similar downregulation as the immunocytochemistry, the western blot analysis of NBS1 is unclear. However, the immunocytochemistry suggests that NBS1 is also downregulated by VD 3 in vivo, and therefore, it may be implied that both the HRR and NHEJ pathways are involved in the cellular effects of VD 3 in HNSCC.",Biological Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1190&context=uop_etds,2013,-21.665855,-7.660419,"The Rad51 family of proteins Interactions, vitamin D, and implications in head and neck cancer","Lu, D."

Algae have been shown to significantly impact DO concentrations in the Deep Water Ship Channel (DWSC) of the San Joaquin River (SJR) estuary. Zooplankton grazing is one of the important mechanisms that influence the fate and spatial distribution of algae, and therefore, may contribute to DO deficits that adversely impact aquatic habitat and salmonid migration in the SJR estuary. Numerical water quality models developed to simulate and predict dissolved oxygen in the SJR rely on mathematical algorithms that link chemical and biological mechanisms. Due to the complexity of natural systems, calibrating these models is challenging and often requires independent investigations to estimate input parameters, such as zooplankton grazing and algal growth rates. This investigation explored the applicability of three methods to quantify the rates that zooplankton graze on algae populations in the SJR. Zooplankton grazing studies were performed in the DWSC of the SJR from June 2012 through July 2013. Light and dark bottle microcosm studies using the dilution method, the food-removal method, and the grazer concentration method were tested. A modified microcosm approach similar to the grazer concentration method was developed that yielded changes in chlorophyll a concentrations that were sufficient to separate zooplankton grazing from algal growth and respiration. Microcosms contained zooplankton concentrations that were up to 30 times higher than natural, background levels. Zooplankton grazing rates were consistent in both magnitude and variability with literature values reported for other waters, ranging from 0.295-3.404-m 3 gC -1 d -1 and 0.006-1.413-m 3 gC -1 d -1 for light and dark bottle microcosms, respectively.",Engineering,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1222&context=uop_etds,2013,-9.921135,-2.4031625,"Zooplankton phytoplankton interactions in the San Joaquin River, Ca","Moon, C."

Some clinicians have reported that parental death is the most stressful life event for children, and some studies have traced adults' mental health difficulties to unresolved childhood grief (Balk, 1983; Krahnstoever, 2006). Despite the hardships endured after a family member's death, some children manage to endure the pain of loss better than others because they are resilient due to a variety of protective factors (Masten, 2003; Bonanno, 2004). The present study examined the relationships between childhood grief, potential protective factors (social support, physical and academic self-concept, parent-child relationship quality) and adolescent outcomes (depression, social satisfaction, and academic achievement). Longitudinal data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Study of Early Child Care (SECC) was utilized in the present study. The sample consisted of 1,364 children, including 261 children who experienced the death of at least one family member in third or fifth grade. There were twelve moderation analyses that were used to examine buffering effects in the present study. Findings in the present study did not support the hypotheses that the psychosocial factors examined could be protective factors between experiencing the death of a family member and the adolescent outcomes examined. Results also revealed a significant main effect of social support, parent-child relationship quality, and physical and academic self-concept whereby those with higher levels of these psychosocial factors tend to have lower levels of depression. Having higher physical and academic self-concept was found to be positively associated with academic achievement. Contrary to what might be expected, a main effect of having higher levels of social support, parent-child relationship quality, physical self-concept, and academic self-concept were associated with lower levels of social satisfaction.

The problem that remains elusive to biochemists is how a protein's primary sequence directs the folding to adopt such a specific conformation. In an attempt to gain a better understanding of protein folding, my research tests a novel model of protein packing using protein design. The model defines the knob-socket construct as the fundamental unit of packing within protein structure. The knob-socket model characterizes packing specificity in terms of amino acid preferences for sockets in different environments: sockets filled with a knob are involved in inter-helical interactions and free sockets are involved in intra-helical interactions. Equipped with this knowledge, I sought to design a unique protein, Ksα1.1, completely de novo. The sequence was selected to induce helix formation with a predefined tertiary packing interface. Circular dichroism showed that Ksα1.1 formed α-helical secondary structure as intended. The nuclear magnetic resonance studies demonstrated formation of a high order oligomer with increased protein concentration.

The current study investigated the significance of early school motivation, academic self-concept and the student-teacher relationship in predicting student-reported school engagement at the age of 15 after controlling for race, gender, socioeconomic status, previous attendance, and previous achievement. This study included participants from the National Institute of Child Health and Development (NICHD) Study of Early Child Care (SECC) a comprehensive research database. It was hypothesized that student reported motivation in grade 5 would predict student reported school engagement at age 15, and that English self-concept and math self-concept in grade 6 and at age 15 would mediate this relationship. Findings from the data supported these hypotheses, establishing a relationship between early motivation and later engagement. Additionally, self-concept in both English and math was found to mediate that relationship. Self-concept in English and math at both grade 6 and age 15 had mediating effects on the relationship between motivation and engagement.

Rosasco,"Mathematics education, Higher education, Education, Advanced Placement, Calculus, Learning outcomes","Students are entering college having earned credit for college Calculus 1 based on their scores on the College Board's Advanced Placement (AP) Calculus AB exam. Despite being granted credit for college Calculus 1, it is unclear whether these students are adequately prepared for college Calculus 2. College calculus classes are often taught from a more theoretical perspective rather than AP Calculus courses taught in high schools, and many students who enter college mathematics with Calculus 2—who possess AP credit for Calculus 1—have found the theoretical perspective of college Calculus 2 courses to be overwhelming. Consequently, these students have not performed well in Calculus 2. This has led to a belief that students with AP Calculus credit for Calculus 1 do not perform as well in college Calculus 2 in comparison to their peers who earned credit for college Calculus 1. Simultaneously, a contradicting belief exists: Students with AP Calculus credit for college Calculus 1 are the strongest students in college Calculus 2, outperforming their peers. The goal of this quantitative study was to compare the learning outcomes of students in college Calculus 2 of students with and without AP Calculus AB credit for college Calculus 1. In analyzing the data, four distinct entry points into college mathematics on a path to college Calculus 2 were identified: Calculus 2 having earned credit for Calculus 1 by means of the AP Calculus AB, Calculus 1 despite having taken AP Calculus in high school, Calculus 1 having not taken AP Calculus in high school, and Pre-Calculus. Each of these entry points were analyzed to identify measures of success in high school and college which are associated with success in college Calculus 2. The results of this study suggest that students with AP Calculus credit for college Calculus 1 do outperform their peers in Calculus 2. Furthermore, the higher the entry point into college mathematics, the better a student is likely to do in Calculus 2. Measures of success that were found to be positively associated with success in Calculus 2 include high school cumulative grade point average and college Calculus 1 grade. A measure that was found to be negatively associated with Calculus 2 success was the number of times a student repeated Calculus 1 prior to enrolling in Calculus 2.",Education,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&context=uop_etds,2013,6.0825405,-2.2679062,Factors associated with success in college Calculus II,"Rosasco, M."

The fate of an orally administered drug is dependent on many parameters before it can reach the systemic circulation, including drug absorption and first-pass metabolism in the gut and the liver. Mammalian cells lines such as MDCK and Caco-2 are commonly employed to assess drug permeability but they lack or have low expression level of drug metabolism enzyme expression such as CYP3A4, which contributes to significant first-pass gut and liver metabolism for many drugs. Consequently, these cell lines are not sufficient to integrate metabolism when assessing drug absorption. Here, we tested MDCK and IEC-18 cells transiently over-expressing CYP3A4 as models that can simultaneously assay a compound's permeability and metabolism potential in a single experiment. Method. A recombinant adenovirus carrying the hCYP3A4 cDNA was constructed according to Stratagene's AdEasy XL Adenoviral system. This adenovirus was used to transiently transfect hCYP3A4 into MDCK and IEC-18 cells. Western blot was performed to assess the level of hCYP3A4 expression in the wild type and CYP3A4 over-expressing IEC-18 and MDCK cells. In situ metabolism and transport studies were performed with wild-types and IEC-18-3A4 or MDCK-3A4 cells. Results. The amount of CYP3A4 present in MDCK-3A4 cells was 250 times to that of wild type cells which 1/4th the amount present in human liver microsomes. The amount of CYP3A4 present in IEC-18-3A4 cells was 150 times to that of wild type cells which 1/6th the amount present in human liver microsomes. In metabolism studies, there was higher formation of metabolites in cells transfected with hCYP3A4 compared to controls. In addition, apical to basal transport studies of several drugs in IEC-18-3A4 and MDCK-3A4 showed increased appearance of metabolites compared to the wild-type cells. Conclusions.

Ainpl suppresses hypoxia inducible factor-1a (HIF-1α) signaling pathway through an ARNTdependent manner. HIF-1α is known to be overexpressed in more than 90% of solid tumors, and the inhibition of HIF-1α is proved as an effective approach to suppress tumor growth. ARNT, as the obligatory heterodimeric partner of HIF-1α for downstream gene activation, was used as a bait to screen for Ainpl. Ainpl specifically interacts with the helix-loop-helix (HLH) subdomain of ARNT, but not with HIF-1α. GFP-Ainpl is localized in both cytoplasm and nucleus, and suppresses HIF-1α signaling by two mechanisms: (1) cytoplasmic GFP-Ainp 1 retains ARNT in the cell cytoplasm and (2) nuclear GFP-Ainpl inhibits HIF-1α/ARNT heterodimerization. The suppression of Ainpl on HIF-1α signaling was reversed by introducing ARNT into the cells using transient transfection. We further utilized HIV TAT protein transduction domain to deliver 6His-TAT-Ainpl into three different cancer cell lines (Hep3B, HeLa, MCF-7), and found that 6His-TAT-Ainpl co-localizes with ARNT in the cell nucleus. 6His-TATAinpl can be detected inside the cells after 30 min of transduction, and can reach the maximum level at 2 h. 6His-TAT-Ainp 1 remained detectable in the cells up to 96 h and had a half life of 24 h after transduction. In addition, 6His-TAT-Ainp 1 suppresses HIF-1α downstream genes at both message and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, molecules that target the HIF-1α and ARNT interface can be developed as viable drugs to suppress HIF-1α signaling.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,,2013,-24.170929,-13.071289,Mechanistic study of aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT)-mediated signaling,"Wang, Y."

We still do not fully understand the entirety of what happens in this mysterious world. The field of underwater sensor networks is a means of monitoring these environments. However, underwater sensor networks are still fraught with challenges; one of the main challenges being communication. In this thesis we look to improve communication in underwater sensor networks. We expand a simulation environment that models node to node communication in an underwater sensor network that utilizes AquaNodes. We address issues with the first iteration of the environment, expand it to include packet-loss for acoustic communication, and make the addition of three dimensional topologies. We found that acoustic packet-loss had a larger impact on the energy consumption of the communication algorithms with more acoustic communication and three dimensional topologies do not affect the communication algorithms. In addition to expanding the simulation environment we also explore using UAVs as a means of extracting data out of underwater sensor network. We conduct field experiments to characterize radio communication, develop an energy model to understand the energy limitations of an UAV, and develop overall policies for using an UAV with an underwater sensor network that utilizes AquaNodes. We learned that node to node radio communication range on the surface of the water had shorter ranges than on land.

It was suggested that enzymes exclusively associated with hydrogenosome were responsible for activating metronidazole. This provoked researchers to target hydrogensosomal enzymes such as pyruvate: ferredoxin oxioreductase and ferredoxin, to treat trichomoniasis caused by T. vaginalis. Recent studies have shown alternative pathways responsible for activating metronidazole without the involvement of hydrogenosomal enzymes. This pathway requires the participation of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase. These enzymes are essential for T.vaginalis' survival as it is responsible for maintaining cell's redox system, as well as many other cellular processes. Targeting thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase could be a novel drug target to treat metronidazole-resistant T. vaginalis. In this study, recombinant T. vaginalis TrxR and T. vaginalis Trx were produced to test its activity against known TrxR inhibitor, auranofin, using DTNB assay. Cell lysates of metronidazole susceptible and metronidazole resistant lines were also tested to see its activity against auranofin. Auranofin derivatives that were effective on E. histolytica recombinant TrxR were also tested to compare their effects on T. vaginalis recombinant TrxR. The results showed that auranofin effectively inhibits recombinant TvTrxR. Aurnofin derivatives were also shown to have different effects on inhibiting the activity of recombinant TvTrxR. It is known that auranofin also targets mammalian TrxR. With the degree of different inhibitions observed between auranofin derivatives, it opened the possibility of developing an auranofin derivative that can specifically targets thioredoxin reductase of parasitic protozoan, T. vaginalis.",Biological Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1191&context=uop_etds,2013,-21.983332,-11.401944,Biochemical analysis of a potential drug target in the human protozoal pathogen Trichomonas vaginalis,"Yun, J."

However, the mechanisms underlying the interaction of sex and diabetes remain to be investigated. This study investigates whether there are 1) sex differences in the development of abnormal vascular responses and 2) changes in the relative contributions of endothelium-derived relaxing factors (EDRFs) in modulating vascular reactivity of mesenteric arteries taken from streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats at early and intermediate stages of the disease (one and eight weeks, respectively). We also investigated the mesenteric expression of the mRNAs for endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and NADPH oxidase (Nox) in STZ-induced diabetes in both sexes. Vascular responses to acetylcholine (ACh) in mesenteric arterial rings pre-contracted with phenylephrine were measured before and after pretreatment with indomethacin (cyclooxygenase inhibitor), L -NAME (NOS inhibitor), or barium chloride (K IR blocker) plus ouabain (Na + -K + ATPase inhibitor). We demonstrated that ACh-induced relaxations were significantly impaired in mesenteric arteries from both male and female diabetic rats at one and eight weeks. However, at eight weeks the extent of impairment was significantly greater in diabetic females than diabetic males. Our data also showed that in females, the levels of eNOS and Nox2- and Nox4-dependent NADPH oxidase mRNA expression and the relative importance of NO to the regulation of vascular reactivity were substantially enhanced, while the importance of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) was significantly reduced at both one and eight weeks after the induction of diabetes. This study reveals the predisposition of female rat mesenteric arteries to vascular injury after the induction of diabetes, may be due to a shift away from a putative EDHF, initially the major vasodilatory factor, towards a greater reliance on NO, and the interaction of oxidative stress with elevated NO.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1160&context=uop_etds,2013,-5.98443,-15.714944,Sex differences in mesenteric endothelial function of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats The role of endothelium-derived relaxing factors,"Zhang, R."

In particular, such a switch, when incorporated into cationic liposomes, provides a novel design of the pH-sensitive helper lipids for gene delivery. Protonation of TACH molecules results in a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond between the amino and its neighboring hydroxyl groups, which triggers a conformational flip, and forces changes of the relative position of other substituents on the ring. In this work, a library of TACH-lipids has been designed and built based on structural modifications of both hydrophilic headgroups and hydrophobic tails, and their conformational behavior has been studied by 1 H NMR. NMR-titration has been done to quantitatively monitor the conformational switch for TACH derivatives. It was discovered that conformational behavior of TACH-lipids is independent from the length or shape of their hydrophobic tails. Therefore, a simplified model was suggested based on TACH with diethyl groups instead of hydrocarbon tails. Conformational study of these models has demonstrated that the position of equilibrium shift A [special characters omitted] BH + can be effectively changed by altering structure of NR 2 R 3 group. Furthermore, the pH-induced conformational flip occurs in a certain pH range that mostly depends on the basicity of group NR 2 R 3 , allowing a broad tuning of the pH-sensitivity of TACH-based conformational switches in a wide range of acidity. The hydrophilic OH group was also modified to influence the conformational equilibrium. External stimuli including addition of acid, change of solvent and of the solution ionic strength also showed impact on conformation equilibrium to different extents. To explore the potential to serve as pH-sensitive helper lipids in gene delivery, a variety of TACH-lipids were incorporated into lipoplexes together with the cationic lipid DOTAP to mediate DNA transfection in Bl6F1 and HeLa cancer cell lines. The lipoplex comprising TACH-lipid 3o (R 1 = C 19 H 37 ; R 2 R 3 = CF 3 CH 2 NH) exhibited one to two orders of magnitude better transfection efficiency than the one with the conventional helper lipid DOPE while only inducing slight higher cytotoxicity. Thus, the lipid can be suggested as a novel helper lipid for efficient gene transfection with low cytotoxicity.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1152&context=uop_etds,2013,-18.518347,-9.133333,Synthesis and conformational study of trans-2-aminocyclohexanol-based pH-triggered molecular switches and their application in gene delivery,"Zheng, Y."

The first study analyzed the expectations and efficacy of new ATs in the management of disordered eating and eating disorders. This was evaluated from the perspective of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Athletics Administrators, Athletic Training Education Program (ATEP) Directors, and new ATs. The results indicate high expectations for ATs but low levels of efficacy in these specific areas. The second study investigated the relationship between a variety of teaching methods and the efficacy of new ATs in the management of disordered eating and eating disorders. The findings demonstrated an increase in levels of preparation and efficacy when alternative teaching methods were used. These methods included teaching in a clinical setting, using role-play scenarios, and implementing real-life scenarios. A combination of these methods and lecture also increased the levels of preparation and efficacy. These results were in-line with Vygotsky's sociocultural learning theory and confirmed the benefits of learning in a social context. The third study examined the need to determine what types of support existed in NCAA athletics departments to assist ATs in fulfilling these responsibilities. Article three evaluated the existence of eating disorder policies, specific guidelines for prevention, recognition, and intervention, and the presence of disordered eating management in the AT job description. The NCAA athletics departments with the above three items were better prepared to handle disordered eating and eating disorder situations and offered more continuing education opportunities to ATs. However, these departments demonstrated increased levels of perceived prevalence of disordered eating among their student-athletes. Overall, these three articles provide a greater understanding of the expectations and efficacy of new ATs.

Balghonaim,"Cellular biology, Dentistry, Biological sciences, Health and environmental sciences","Background: In the bone marrow, hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells form a unique niche, in which oxygen tension is low. Hypoxia may have a role in maintaining stem cell capacity for self-renewal and multipotency. We have shown previously a positive influence of platelet-derived growth factors (PDF) on increase of multiplication rate of human mesenchymal stem cells cultured in normal atmosphere. Objective: The goal of this study is to examine effects of platelet-derived factors and thrombin on multiplication of adult human mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow (hBMMSC) in a low or in a high oxygen environment in vitro. Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that PDF will have no effect on multiplication of BMMSC cultured in a low oxygen environment and that thrombin will have no effect on multiplication of BMMSC in either low or high oxygen atmosphere. Materials and methods: Adult human mesenchymal stem cells isolated from bone marrow aspirate (Lonza) were used. Cells were grown in plastic flasks or dishes. The human mesenchymal stem cell basal medium (Lonza) was supplemented with adult human serum with or without PDF or with or without thrombin. High and low oxygen environment (Biospherix) was applied during expansion of hBMMSC. Results: Cultivation medium containing PDF in 5% oxygen increased multiplication rate of hBMMSC. Thrombin addition to the cultivation medium had a positive influence on cell multiplication in 21% oxygen atmosphere, but not in presence of 5% oxygen. Conclusions: PDF enhanced proliferation of hBMMSC grown in 5% oxygen when compared to controls. Thrombin had a stimulatory effect in 21% oxygen environment. These findings will be utilized in an optimized protocol used for cultivation of hBMMSC preceding their clinical application. The hBMMSC need to be grown in physiological conditions and for the shortest cultivation period possible. 6",Dentistry,,2012,-14.813676,-5.8163214,Effect of platelet factors and thrombin on multiplication of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells cultured in low and high oxygen level in vitro,"Balghonaim, A."

The characterization of 6 zebrafish Zipper Interacting Protein Kinase homolog has helped to better understand how changes in cell cytoskeletal elements can lead to changes in cell shape and movement. Zebrafish are ideal model organisms for studying ZIPK because it has been previously shown that zebrafish ZIPK has closer sequence homology to human ZIPK than rodent ZIPK, and because zebrafish embryos are ideal for studying cell shape and movement in vivo. Using Whole Mount In Situ Hybridization we found that the zebrafish ZIPK is expressed during all stages of embryonic development, but most importantly during gastrulation when cell motility and changes in cell shape can best be studied. To determine where zebrafish ZIPK is expressed at the sub-cellular level, GFP-ZIPK and Flag-ZIPK clones were created and used for transfecting into Hek293T cells and Hela Cells. From these transfections, cell counterstaining and confocal microscopy we found that ZIPK is expressed ubiquitously throughout the cell, although mainly cytoplasmic. To study the effects on cell shape various ZIPK mutants were created through site-directed mutagenesis. These mutants were made to study the effects of the kinase domain of the protein, or other functional domains within the protein. From these studies it was shown that ZIPK does affect cell shape through changes in the actomyosin cytoskeleton resulting in aberrant cytoskeletal structures. Finally, we have also shown through phosphorylation assays that ZIPK phosphorylates and thus regulates MYPT-1, a scaffolding protein of the myosin protein phosphate complex and directly phosphorylates myosin light chain, both of which play a role in changes in cell shape and movement.",Biological Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1816&context=uop_etds,2012,-23.424906,-14.353873,Characterization of the zebrafish zipper interacting protein kinase homolog,"Basepayne, T."

This study found that participants provide an instructionally stable and efficient learning environment in the CPA academic classroom setting, one in which teachers get to know students well and have the flexibility to modify their instructional practices to meet the needs and goals of the academy program. The findings provided evidence that participants' instructional practices with their academy students are different from the instructional practices in their traditional non-academy classrooms. Differences include how participants plan for instruction, the curriculum materials and teaching strategies they use, how they assess student learning, and what classroom culture is established.

Rather, it is a combination of teacher's actions (e.g. classroom culture they establish), behaviors (e.g. role and teacher-student relationships), and beliefs (e.g. self-efficacy) that contribute to their ability to move from a traditional instructional setting to a career-oriented environment. In addition, the collaborative nature of the academy team of teachers and the commitment they make to implement the goals of the academy to ensure student success constitute significant findings that compliment the current research. These findings also build on or expand the research by presenting examples of the curriculum, pedagogical, and assessment practices found in career academy settings. Findings are significant for practitioners who seek to understand what is needed from teachers, administrators and teacher educators to improve the environment of high school programs and close the instructional gap currently found in our nation's secondary schools.",Education,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&context=uop_etds,2012,18.531868,8.244473,"Teachers in California partnership academies Roles, relationships and student success","Carnahan, D."

This emphasis on improving education has been spurred due to the alleged failure of the public school system. As a result, the role of administrators has evolved to incorporate data-driven decision-making practices to help make educational choices. While the underlying assumption of implementing data-driven decision making is that it will lead to improvements in education, this has yet to be empirically proven. The purpose of the study was to analyze the relationships among school characteristics, principals' level of experience, principals' data-driven decision making practices, and student achievement. This census study addressed principals of k-5 public elementary schools. In this quantitative study, a web-based survey was used to measure principals' data-driven ion-making practices. The student achievement data examined were the California Standards Test results for English language arts and mathematics for the 2009–2010 and 2010–2011 school years. Through a series of multiple regression analyses, the study examined the relationships among school characteristics, principals' level of experience, principals' data-driven decision making practices, and student achievement. Specifically. this study explored the amount of variance in student achievement scores in language arts and mathematics that could be explained by school characteristics, principals' level of experience, and data-driven decision-making practices. The results showed principals are incorporating data-driven decision-making practices in k-5 public elementary schools in California. In addition, the results showed that principals believe the quality of their decision making has improved due to implementing data-driven decision making. Principals indicated they were incorporating practices identified in the four constructs used in the present study: (a) establishing a data-driven culture, (b) data-driven decision making by teachers to improve student achievement, (c) supporting systems for DDDM, and (d) collaboration among teachers using data-driven decision making.

A case study approach was used to conduct an in-depth look at teachers' practices through teacher interviews and classroom observations. All teachers in the study participated in a high school level college-access program aimed at increasing the college-going rate of under-served youth. Further, each participant had at least three years' experience in the program. The research suggests that there may be a teacher typology even within a voluntary college preparatory program. This typology is not limited to the suggested categories of this study. Nor does this typology suggest that teachers are stagnant categories of this study. Nor does this typology suggest that teachers are stagnant within their assigned typology. Rather, the research suggests that there is a continuum of teacher ability with regards to implementation of practices and ideas around cultural, human, and social capital. Outcomes suggest that school administrators should examine their practices in monitoring and supporting the implementation of professional development. Further, school administrators should consider matching school reform initiative with teacher type.

The largest source of nonpoint pollution is storm water runoff, which includes pollutants such as sediment, nutrients, metals, microorganisms, and organic compounds. Sediment is of particular importance because many pollutants are readily 5 adsorbed onto particles. In the Lake Tahoe basin, sediment is also significant because of its direct contribution to clarity attenuation. The most prudent control measure for mitigating sediment flux in the Lake Tahoe basin is infiltration, which captures runoff volume, allowing it to percolate into the soil and enter groundwater. All residential parcels in the Lake Tahoe basin are required to have an on-site infiltration system. These systems require rigorous maintenance to maintain full function. Negligence can lead to premature clogging from debris and accumulated sediment, and the cost of rehabilitating or replacing the system can be significant to homeowners.

This study aimed to understand the strategies and thoughts of a select group of professors of reading education as they worked with pre-service teachers in preparing them to meet the needs' of their future students. The four respondents that participated in this inquiry were professors of reading education at various California Universities. The guiding research question was stated as: What are the issues surrounding the teaching and learning of reading through digital media? Two sub-questions were also posed: What strategies and practices are reading educators using in teaching reading education with traditional and digital media? In what ways are reading educators connecting traditional and digital literacy skills? Multiple case study methodology was used to acquire various perspectives on the issues of teaching and learning through digital media. From the four cross-case analyses of interviews, documentation, and observations, four themes and an overarching theme emerged depicting the issues educators are discovering with digital media. Reading competency is driven by intrinsic motivation. Current practices which neglect ""real-world"" reading are producing student who know how to read, but do not have the desire to read. The pressures to conform to educational mandates has created a disconnect between ""good teaching"" strategies and mandated school district requirements. The use of updated practices utilizing digital media is tempered by the current knowledge and self-efficacy of professors of reading education, as well as, the inconsistent availability and/or limited technological accessibility. These four themes acted as the foundation in support of the culminating theme. The overarching theme indicated that meeting the needs of today's students by looking at education through a new lens and gaining tools and strategies for the 21st century is imperative. Since the professor of reading educations' knowledge and self-efficacy is essential in the process of integrating digital media, the respondents themselves are transforming the practices and perceptions of educators. Thus, professors of reading education are change agents in their own practices, Universities, surrounding schools and the community.

The study focused on student-athletes who received athletically-related financial aid at a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I-AAA institution. The Academic Progress Rate (APR), which measures academic eligibility and retention while incorporating a penalty structure for underperforming teams and athletic departments, has emerged as the fundamental measure of academic success for intercollegiate athletics programs. Educators have responded with a broad spectrum of support programs for student-athletes in order to meet APR benchmarks and avoid costly penalties. The NCAA first permitted the awarding of athletic aid to incoming student-athletes for summer pre-enrollment during the early part of the last decade. However, relatively little research has examined the concept of summer pre-enrollment and the role it may play in a student-athlete's adjustment and transition to college. The researcher conducted retrospective in-depth interviews with seven men's and women's basketball student-athletes who had completed one year of full-time enrollment at the selected institution and who received athletic aid for their summer pre-enrollment. Data was analyzed in a manner consistent with Boeije's Constant Comparative Analysis. This study drew upon Schlossberg's Transition Theory, and the participants described their experience in relation to their situation, self, support, and strategies. Collectively, the findings suggested that the participants perceived at least some benefit to their academic adjustment and social integration to college from the summer pre-enrollment. Though the summer pre-enrollment may not have provided identical academic, athletic, and social demands as the academic year, most of the participants indicated they were able to gain a better understanding of what college classes and college life were like as a result of their summer pre-enrollment participation. The findings further suggested that the participants were well prepared and well equipped for the demands of college prior to their summer pre-enrollment experience.

School districts in California are allowed to set their own reclassification criteria, based on guidelines from the State Board of Education. Various reclassification policies may present problems, such as inappropriate placement and provision of services which would widen the academic deficit of English learners and place them at greater risk for long-term academic problems. The purposes of this study were to analyze the reclassification criteria among districts in the Northern San Joaquin Valley and Foothill area of California, to learn how districts arrive at their current criteria, and to know what modifications and recommendations district leaders who are in charge of English learner services would suggest regarding reclassification. Policies from 23 K-12 school districts in the studied area were collected and analyzed. Interviews with 12 district leaders who are in charge of English learner programs and services were conducted to find out how districts developed their criteria and their suggestions for modifications and recommendations regarding reclassification. Data collected from school districts' policies revealed a diverse set of practices in the establishment of the reclassification criteria although the majority of the school districts studied met the SBE guidelines to reclassify EL students. There is a range of selected cut points for English language proficiency and the California Standardized Tests. There is also a wide variety of measures and their specific requisites that are being used as part of the teachers' evaluation of students' curriculum mastery requirements. Parental opinion and consultation were presented in 22 out of 23 policies collected. Furthermore, an array of miscellaneous requirements was found in the majority of districts' criteria. The differences in districts' reclassification criteria prompted concerns regarding reclassified students' proficiency levels and performance.

Barriers to graduation completion in San Joaquin County public high schools continue to leave stakeholders looking for solutions to change the status quo for African American male high schools students. Ten San Joaquin County African American male and female administrators (identified by pseudonyms) from various public elementary, middle, and high schools were interviewed individually. Participants' responses were categorized into themes according to their answers for each question. Contrary to explanations for low graduation rates of African American male students, as predicted in the literature review of this study, the participants' perspectives rarely indicated that discipline, or lack of parental involvement was a prevailing reason for low graduation rates for African American male students. Low teacher expectations, lack of role models and advocates, and the failure of the school systems to implement successful strategies to improve the graduation rates of African American male students appeared to be the most common themes as discussed in the literature review. Participants perspectives suggest public high schools in San Joaquin County struggle to make positive connections with African American male students. All of the participants claimed that teachers, administrators, and school staff struggle to build and maintain healthy relationships with African American male students.

Localization is defined as linguistically and culturally adapting a product for the target language in the local area, region, or country where it will be marketed, sold, or used. The focus of the study was on the Latino/Hispanic and Mexican markets as two separate targets. I considered issues of cultural identity, language preference, and acculturation to determine how to adapt websites for each group and compared how localization plans are different and what leads to such differences. It examined how localization professionals working with either of the two target markets define effectiveness, and it evaluated and compared four different websites considered localized for their intended audiences based on literature review and interview findings. I utilized qualitative in-depth interviews of localization professionals and a visual assessment of four websites' cultural values and linguistic preferences for targeted markets based on what is considered effective. Localization professionals function as interpreters who apply their role to their work as Internet/website/technical specialists. For instance, the basic qualifications for Localization Project Managers are fluency in more than one language, experience with translation tools, familiarity with software applications, and experience working internationally and with other cultures. The interview questions were open ended in order to gather and codify aspects of general themes while allowing interviewees to bring up topics and issues that I did not include on my questionnaire.

As products of their backgrounds and affiliations teachers bring personal attitudes and beliefs to their teaching. The purpose of this study was to explore how biology teachers perceive, describe, and value their teaching of evolution. This research question was explored through a heuristic qualitative methodology. Eight veteran California high school biology teachers were queried as to their beliefs, perceptions, experiences and practices of teaching evolution. Both personal and professional documents were collected. Data was presented in the form of biographical essays that highlight teachers' backgrounds, experiences, perspectives and practices of teaching evolution. Of special interest was how they describe pressure over teaching evolution during a decade of standards and No Child Left Behind high-stakes testing mandates. Five common themes emerged. Standards have increased the overall amount of evolution that is taught. High-stakes testing has decreased the depth at which evolution is taught. Teacher belief systems strongly influence how evolution is taught. Fear of creationist challenges effect evolution teaching strategies. And lastly, concern over the potential effects of teaching evolution on student worldviews was mixed. Three categories of teacher concern over the potential impact of evolution on student worldviews were identified: Concerned, Strategist, and Carefree.

This case study sought to discover how one school district in California successfully completed the task of adopting and implementing an RTI program with relatively few complications. Themes from interviews and documents revealed that adoption and implementation of the RTI model closely followed Rogers Diffusion of Innovation theory. Among other findings it is also suggested that teachers are more likely to support innovation when they consider themselves part of a team and when they feel their students will benefit from the innovation.

Results of the current study indicated that all four participants were most active in the Interactive Play condition and the percentage of MVPA varied across test and control conditions. In addition, the frequency and duration of bouts of MVPA was greatest in the Interactive Play condition.

Ten public universities were randomly selected from twenty-nine four-year universities in Zhejiang province. Documents related to student conduct systems from ten universities were analyzed, and thirteen administrators and one school counselor from nine universities were interviewed. While the findings of this study supported the previous research on many points, this study differed from the current literature in three important ways. First, this study provided insight into perceptions of administrators and counselors working at the forefront of SCS at Chinese universities regarding the educational purposes of SCSs and how the campus community members attempted to make the student conduct system work to achieve those purposes. This study also provided administrators' understanding of tension between educational roles of SCSs and damaging effects of formal punitive sanctions on students. Second, this study illustrated how administrators and counselors dealt with the educational and legal nature of SCSs while handling student conduct issues. This study first showed that student rights the investigated Chinese universities accorded exceed what laws and regulations require. Meanwhile, this study suggested that administrators appeared inure practical in dealing with student misconduct: they were trying to make a balance between complying with the basic legal requirements and handling student conduct issues more effectively and efficiently. The study showed that the majority of disciplinary cases were handled through informal resolution and administrators tended not to complicated the disciplinary processes.

Peer discovery and lowlevel networking have been dealt with by previous research. In this thesis we describe and evaluate eight possible routing schemes with different system-knowledge requirements. We show that with a minimal set of information it is possible to achieve near-optimal results with energy costs considerably lower than centralized optimal algorithms. We demonstrate this by constructing and evaluating a custom simulation environment in MATLAB. This is implemented in a mixed procedural and array-centric approach. Simulated networks are structured on a line topology. All nodes a spaced along the horizontal axis at a random depth. It is assumed that neighbor-discovery has been completed before the simulation starts, and all nodes have access to a global list of connected neighbors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of distributed algorithms in an ideal environment, leading to the conclusion that near-optimal results can be achieved with local information only.",Engineering,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1810&context=uop_etds,2012,-8.400591,0.42672926,Simulating underwater sensor networks and routing algorithms in MATLAB,"O'Rourke, M."

To overcome these challenges, research has focused its attention on the development of nano-based delivery systems that can penetrate the leaky vasculature of tumor endothelium, use site-directed ligands that can bind with high affinity and specific ity to tumor cells, physically entrap poorly soluble drugs, and deliver these cytotoxic agents directly to the tumor site. One approach to nanosystem drug delivery is with the use of peptide amphiphiles (PAs) that are conjugated with the Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic Acid (RGD) motif to actively target a αVβ3 integrin receptors on cancer cells or tumor endothelium. The current work is focused on mechanistic studies to evaluate the uptake of novel RGD amphiphi les with varying alkyl chain lengths (palmitic acid : Cl 6 and stearic acid: C 18) and hydrophilic linkers, 8-amino- 3,6-dioxaoctonoic acid (ADA) or glucose, as micellar delivery systems of hydrophobic anticancer agents. PAs were confirmed for their self-assembling properties and further evaluated for their RGD-mediated binding specificity to purified αVβ3 integrin through a competitive binding fluorescence polarization assay (with novel RGD micelles displacing an integrin-bound fluorescent RGD probe by as much as 63.03%). Ultimately, these nanocarriers were assessed for their ability to deliver phys ically entrapped fluorescein isoth iocyanate (FITC) to A2058 cells overexpressing αVβ3 integrin receptors. Results from confocal microscopy indicate that uptake of RGD micelles was driven by an energy-dependent mechanism, as statistically significant levels of FITC internalization was seen at 37°C versus 4°C (p-value<0.05 for all treatment groups); moreover, intracellular fluorescence was notably higher (as much as 4-fold) when delivered through novel RGD conjugates as opposed to its free form.

In the first, metal-cyclopentadienyl bond dissociation energies (BDEs) were measured for seven metallocene ions (Cp2M+, Cp = η5-cyclopentadienyl = c-C5H5, M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) using threshold collision-induced dissociation (TCID) performed in a guided ion beam tandem mass spectrometer. For all seven room temperature metallocene ions, the dominant dissociation pathway was simple Cp loss from the metal. Traces of other fragment ions were also detected, such as C10H10+, C10H8+, C8H8+, C3H3+, H2M+, C3H3M+, C6H6M+, and C7H6M+, depending on the metal center. Statistical modeling of the Cp-loss TCID experimental data, including consideration of energy distributions, multiple collisions, and kinetic shifts, allow the extraction of 0 K [CpM+ - Cp] BDEs.

Principals are faced with deciding how to implement a variety of policies, including curriculum and instruction, student safety and other district initiatives. Special attention is given to suspension because it impacts the average daily attendance funds that schools receive, and if students are not attending school due to suspension, their academic achievement suffers. In addition, there is an increasing national rate of suspension (Ferges, E. & Noguera, P, 2010) that is leading to heightened responsibilities as it relates to discipline. Sacramento County in California was selected as the site of this study due to its diverse population of elementary students. The research question for this study was: How does the intersection of race and gender impact the decisions related to suspensions for African American women elementary school principals? The theoretical framework used to answer this question is Black Feminist Thought (Collins, 2000). Through in-depth interviews, the women revealed how double consciousness and the dual oppression of race and gender impacted their decisions regarding suspension. Black feminist thought focuses on the marginalized status of African American women and places their experiences at the center of the discourse. With this in mind, the data yielded findings in the following areas 1) race, 2) race and gender, 3) suspension, 4) networking, and 5) mentoring. The intent of this study was to contribute to the field by researching African American women elementary school principals. The focus of suspension practices was selected because of the troubling relationship between academic achievement and suspension. The discourse on African American women in educational leadership has historically been silent, as both a gendered and racialized group (Dillard, 1995). This study attempted to expand the majority of research literature on educational leadership, which has primarily focused on the experiences of White men and women (Bell & Chase, 1993).

The distribution of hydrocarbons was found to be more dispersed over a wider area in subsurface waters than previously predicted or reported. Several hydrocarbon plumes were identified including a near-surface plume (0.5 to 50 m), two small mid-depth plume (240 to 290 m and 850 to 880 m), and a large deepwater plume approximately 1,050 to 1,300 m below surface. Water soluble compounds were preferentially extracted from the rising oil in deepwater, and were found at potentially toxic levels both in and outside of areas previously reported to contain the majority of hydrocarbons. Data collected from different research missions were measured for a wide variety of chemical compounds, but not every sample was analyzed for the same chemical compounds. To overcome the challenge of variability in sample data, a non-parametric method of evaluating the percentage of detectable results, was used for all data analysis in addition to evaluation of total sample concentrations. The two analysis techniques yielded similar results. This approach may be useful in other studies in which samples are measured for varying number of compounds and have varying detection limits.

In light of these problems, this exploratory thesis examines two existing frameworks, cosmopolitanism and intercultural relations, in an effort to establish a strong theoretical foundation for the support and development of a moral, ethical, and social justice perspective of education for global citizenship programs in colleges and universities that reflects the traditions of a liberal education. Analysis of the existing scholarship in these two areas shows a commonality between the frameworks that is mostly unrecognized in the literature. Together, the similarities in these two theoretical frameworks combine to make a compelling argument for the continued development of global citizenship programs that focus on peace and social justice. In addition, these frameworks provide effective solutions for the critical problems faced by education for global citizenship programs.",Other,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1802&context=uop_etds,2012,10.942004,4.167496,Education for global citizenship an intercultural and cosmopolitan perspective,"Stead, K."

It is believed that α 1 and α 2 adrenoceptors mediate the 5-HT level in the brain. The mechanism is complex and not well explored. Especially in different combination treatments, the receptor systems may show varied modulation capability. Additionally, some research has suggested that α 2 heteroceptors may contribute to the time delay problem in dual depression treatment which is thought as the time needed for certain inhibition receptor to get desensitized. We hypothesized that the α 2 adrenoceptors had inhibition effect on 5-HT level in dorsal raphé nucleus (DRN), Prefrontal cortex (PFC) and Hippocampus (HP) with the dual reuptake inhibition. The present study was undertaken to explore the effect of BRL44408 (α 2 receptor antagonist) on 5-HT level in rat PFC, DRN and HP under dual antidepressant with blocking the α 1 receptor. Method: Serotonin reuptake inhibitor and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor were used to mimic the dual reuptake inhibition antidepressant. To differentiate the α 2 adrenoceptors effect from al adrenoceptors effect, prazosin, an antagonist of α 1 adrenoceptors, was added to block α 1 adrenoceptors. Using the microdialysis method, the drug combination was examined in HP area and then DRN area to explore the drug effect on time course of 5-HT release in DRN and PFC. Based on the experiment results from DRN and PFC, a mechanism-based pharmacodynamic model was developed. Result: BRL44408 increased the serotonin (5-HT) level in rat PFC, DRN and HP to different degrees with the dual reuptake inhibition (p < 0.05). The overall model reasonably captured the time course of 5-HT in both DRN and PFC with different dose schemes of BRL44408. The model predicted EC50 of BRL44408 (0.0075 µM) for the α 2 heteroreceptor which control PFC 5-HT is close to the reported value of BRL44408 for α 2 adrenorceptor (0.008 µM). However, the model predicted EC50 of BRL44408 on the α 2 heteroreceptor which control DRN 5-HT need to be explained. Simulation result from this model suggested varied modulation capability of α 2 adrenoceptors on the 5-HT in DRN and the 5-HT in PFC. Conclusion: α 2 heteroceptor play a role in regulation 5-HT level under dual reuptake inhibition. Further exploration may bring a potential target for depression treatment. The mechanism model was developed to characterize and better understand the neurotransmitter mechanisms, providing estimations of various parameters of the disease related receptor system.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1153&context=uop_etds,2012,-15.576277,-5.1096807,Exploring the effect of alpha2 receptor on brain 5-HT via a mechanism-based pharmacodynamic model,"Sun, J."

This study aims to make a contribution to the literature by examining how these challenges can be addressed through email computer training. For this study, I set out to understand and demonstrate how, within the instructional design process, contextualized curriculum can be created that integrates intercultural competency and email proficiency. This thesis includes a draft of an instructional plan and course outline for an email computer class that focuses on developing intercultural awareness and skills in the context of an email training course. First, I examined email computer curricula, specifically the topics, course goals, and course objectives common to the curricula. As a result of this examination, I discovered that email training is limited to the technical aspects of email communication. Additionally, I surveyed intercultural communication professionals about intercultural topics applicable to email communication. Their survey responses indicated cultural differences account for some, but not all email workplace challenges. For example, they believed it is important to address intercultural elements like low vs. high context when writing an email message, and power distance and levels of formality when writing greetings and closings. Additionally, their feedback indicated that it is important to address direct vs. indirect communication styles when writing the main point and linear vs. circular cognitive styles when organizing text within an email. I incorporated their perspectives in my course outline. Finally, experts from the fields of instructional design, intercultural communication, and computer training reviewed a draft of the plan and outline. Although their feedback indicated that the premise and approach were sound and achievable, they differed in their evaluation of specific elements of the course. In general, their perspectives reflected their professional focus. For example, they either recommended a stronger focus on the technical aspects or a stronger focus on the intercultural aspects of the course design.

T vagina/is expresses cysteine proteases that have been implicated in vaginal epithelial apoptosis as well as immune system evasion. In the past the various cysteine proteases have been studied as a group, and the following work examines, one specific protease, TvCP2, in detail through Western blot analysis, immunofluorescent staining, and recombinant expression. The experiments 5 presented here suggest that aT l-CP2 over-expressing transfectant line processes CP2 and sequesters it in cellular compartments. Previous data gives strong evidence of the secretion of cysteine protease CP4 and hints at the possibility of CP2 secretion as well; however, our results show no co-localization between CP2 and CP4 in T l-CP2 over expressing transfectants, suggesting separate trafficking and different roles. To better characterize CP2 function, we attempted to express active, recombinant protein. Although Pichia pastoris serves as a reliable expression vehicle, a processing event following translation ofTvCP2 appears to have cleaved the pro-domain and, along with it, the a-secretion signal, trapping active TvCP2 within the cellular pellet.

Recycling is one practical solution to utilize this huge amount of solid waste through activation as substitute for ordinary Portland cement. The central goal of this dissertation is to investigate and develop a new silica-alumina based cementitious material largely using coal refuse as a constituent that will be ideal for durable construction, mine backfill, mine sealing and waste disposal stabilization applications. This new material is an environment-friendly alternative to ordinary Portland cement. The main constituents of the new material are coal refuse and other coal wastes including coal sludge and coal combustion products (CCPs). Compared with conventional cement production, successful development of this new technology could potentially save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, recycle vast amount of coal wastes, and significantly reduce production cost. A systematic research has been conducted to seek for an optimal solution for enhancing pozzolanic reactivity of the relatively inert solid waste-coal refuse in order to improve the utilization efficiency and economy benefit for construction and building materials. The results show that thermal activation temperature ranging from 20°C to 950°C significantly increases the workability and pozzolanic property of the coal refuse. The optimal activation condition is between 700°C to 800°C within a period of 30 to 60 minutes. Microanalysis illustrates that the improved pozzolanic reactivity contributes to the generated amorphous materials from parts of inert aluminosilicate minerals by destroying the crystallize structure during the thermal activation. In the coal refuse, kaolinite begins to transfer into metakaol in at 550°C, the chlorite minerals disappear at 750°C, and muscovite 2M 1 gradually dehydroxylates to muscovite HT. Furthermore, this research examines the environmental acceptance and economic feasibility of this technology and found that this silica alumina-based cementitious material not only meets EPA requirements but also shows several advantages in industrial application.",Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1154&context=uop_etds,2012,-7.7090917,-0.352298,Performance and mechanism on a high durable silica alumina based cementitious material composed of coal refuse and coal combustion byproducts,"Yao, Y."

The traditional suspension polymerization approach was used to synthesize polystyrene-iron oxide (Fe 3 O 4 ) based magnetic beads. The beads were coupled to different surface functional groups. The Fe 3 O 4 particles were encapsulated into a polystyrene shell. The surface functional groups were generated by graft-polymerization with functional monomers. The average size of the beads was in the range of 100-500 μm. Chemical tests showed that the beads were stable in strong acid, strong base and polar solvent. The beads had a fast response to an external magnetic field. A self-emulsion-polymerization approach was developed to synthesize smaller magnetic beads with the - OH groups on the surface. A modified approach based on traditional suspension-polymerization was developed to synthesize acid-durable beads with more Fe 3 O 4 encapsulated inside the beads. A novel emulsion-suspension polymerization method was successfully developed to synthesize much smaller magnetic beads ( A new peptide synthesis approach was developed using functional magnetic beads as the resin for solid phase synthesis. In this application, synthesized magnetic beads were further modified by a two-step reaction. The amino group was anchored onto the surface of these beads, followed by coupling with the Rink amide linker. The resulting beads were used as the resin to synthesize several model peptides. The peptides were successfully synthesized, and the sequences were confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis. The yields of the peptides were comparable to those obtained from commercial Rink amide resin.

SEC was conceptualized as the combination of Emotional and Social Intelligence. Increasingly, areas of SEC have become the subject of research, because SEC enables people to use emotions advantageously to achieve desired outcomes. Measures of seven components of SEC (self-awareness, selfperception, self-regulation, self-motivation, self-ownership, empathy, and social awareness) were evaluated. Qualitative phone interviews were conducted with 21 undergraduate and graduate Communication students whom had recently served as interns. All interviews were recorded and transcribed. Research questions sought to evaluate the effect of internships on (1) self-awareness and self-perception; (2) self-regulation and self-management; (3) self-motivation and career development; and (4) empathy, social awareness and relationship skills.

The respondents were asked questions about how they have adjusted to the instruction of the curriculum, classroom management, monitoring of student achievement, and the level of support received from administration as a result of increased class sizes due to the elimination of California's Class Size Reduction program. The respondents were asked to compare what they did with a class size averaging 20 to their current class size which averaged 28.6 students. The results of the interviews varied, but overall, the teacher's workload, quality of instructional programs, student behavior, and the personal connection between the student and teacher seem to be the areas most affected by larger class sizes. An underlying issue consistently surfaced throughout the interviews. The demands set forth by the district and state, such as pacing and rigorous curricular programs, was an area of concern for the participants in this study.

Published work suggests cross-talk between both proteins and cellular pathways involving the transcription factors, HIF -1 , ER, and NFKB, whose activity is typically upregulated in cancer. This thesis focuses on using a truncated form of AhR, AhR CΔ553, which is thought to act as a dominant-negative to sequester Arnt from its other binding partners. To test this hypothesis, we transfected HeLa cells with AhR CΔ553 fused to pEGFP or a vector under a tetracycline-inducible promoter. Stable cell lines expressing pEGFP-AhR CΔ553 have been generated and confirmed to have nuclear localization. We were also interested in confirming endogenous localization patterns of AhR and Arnt to study the role of p23 in the nuclear translocation of AhR. While we were successful in showing AhR translocating to the nucleus in treated MCF-7 cells, we couldn't clearly see nuclear AhR in Hepalclc7 cells, the cell line with knockdown levels of p23. To compare DNA damage generated in Jm·kat and Hepalclc7 cells, we looked for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and quantified DNA damage after exposure to benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and some of its derivatives. Hepalclc7 cells were prone to a wide variety of DNA damage, but Jurkat cells did not appear to undergo damage specifically through ROS production. Finally, we wanted to confirm apoptosis in HeLa cells after being cocultured with Trichomonas vaginalis. The G3 lab strain was more aggressive than Tl , but Parp, and apoptotic marker, was not observed in HeLa cells, suggesting that experimental conditions need to be further optimized.",Biological Sciences,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1792&context=uop_etds,2011,-19.809484,-11.72731,Analysis of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and a truncated form (AHR C[upper case symbol for greek Delta]Δ553) in cancer cells,"Chow, M."

The goal was to provide meaningful discussion regarding which behaviors students at a top ten university are engaging in and how that may contribute to their ability to thrive academically. Variables such as gender, year enrolled, and GPA were analyzed to arrive at recommendations on how students personally interested in maximizing their academic performance and ability to thrive on campus could incorporate behaviors that have been successful for their peers into their daily routines. Student development theory was also a component of this study. Undergraduate and graduate student wellness behaviors were comparatively analyzed to better comprehend wellness behaviors throughout the stages of enrollment. The study was designed to analyze what phase of development, through the lens of self-authorship, students were engaging in an effort to articulate how these top ten university students are ""making their own ways."" This study found that top ten university students are more positioned to thrive academically and perhaps beyond based on their engagement in wellness behaviors. The study also found that there are relationships among the variables gender, year enrolled, and GPA and specific wellness constructs such that different groups of students require different programmatic options.

Recognizing the importance of childhood experiences, with and within nature, the intent of this study is to interpret the essential meanings associated with these experiences and how these, in turn, are situated in our beliefs and relationship with nature. The targeted respondents for the study were all K-12 educators teaching in schools in Central California. The driving research question is stated as In what ways do childhood experiences with and within the natural environment impact who we are as adults? Three sub-questions were also explored: What personal meanings are associated with childhood memories and experiences of being with and within the natural environment? In what ways do individuals assimilate childhood experiences of the natural environment into their adult beliefs about their relationship with nature? In what ways does the exploration of early childhood nature experiences affect the decision to become environmental advocates? Moustakas' (1990) six-stage heuristic inquiry process was adhered to. The initial data collection began within myself, the researcher. Aspects of the experience, which became the collected data by means of conversations with co-researchers, journal writing, and other personal documents, were filtered by way of my own self-inquiry, sense of eco-literacy and experience with my childhood experiences with and within the natural environment.

However, since such courses are designed to help students adapt to academic and campus cultures, an overlap and alignment between the development of intercultural skills and competence and the development of college competence might exist. This thesis investigated the degree to which intercultural learning was integrated into College Success courses at the curricular level, in instruction practices, and in the individual learning experiences of students, and it also identified current instructional activities most amenable to further targeting of intercultural learning. The research was guided by the following three questions. 1) What are the ways, if any, in which intercultural skills align with those skills seen as necessary for students' successful adaptation in academic and professional settings? 2) Do College Success instructors intentionally or unintentionally incorporate intercultural competence development into the curriculum and instruction? 3) What, if any, are the ways in which instructional practices in College Success courses contribute to intercultural skill development and help students leverage their current experiences with cultural differences? The research was focused on the study of one College Success class at a community college. Data was collected through multiple methods. Class sessions were observed. Interviews were conducted with students in the course, the instructor and the administrator responsible for the course. Documents, including the course syllabus, student learning outcomes, a selection of assignments and the course textbook were reviewed and analyzed. Research findings suggest that there is significant alignment between the development of college competence, as fostered in the College Success course studied, and the development intercultural competence, though such was unintentional and unrecognized by the instructor. The data also illuminated areas where course learning outcomes, curriculum, and instruction could be modified to further support the development of intercultural competency.",Other,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1778&context=uop_etds,2011,6.913029,-2.3068774,Intercultural competency development in student success courses,"Cooper, T."

The researcher interviewed campus officials, key staff and tenured professors who had been instrumental in development of these programs. The data revealed that the growth of these programs was organic, with no formal edict, with only one institution having formalized grant monies to help develop their program. Support for distance programs was not widespread throughout the campus, but rather focused in compartmentalized areas, and in some cases, began with one person venturing out of 'the norm.' This organic growth led to a gradual, but minimal increase in faculty involvement, and administrative support, albeit without any significant investment in course architecture and software support, initially. Institutional support has continued, but does not encourage in a broad sense, continued distance education growth, nor faculty involvement. Marketplace considerations proved a heavy influence on development of these programs. Many students continue to be geographically isolated and there is a heavy concentration of military being transferred from their existing base, and university, unable to transfer credits to a new university at their new duty station. Further development of distance education and online degree programs is a means of assisting institutions of higher learning in reaching more students, geographically isolated from main campus operations. This applies to those existing and potential students in Hawaii, as well as abroad and in the continental United States. Although distance education and online degree programs do not totally replace campus-based courses at these institutions, they do provide an augmentation of existing classroom architecture and allow the student more freedom in the pathway to degree completion.",Education,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1090&context=uop_etds,2011,8.791831,2.3798745,Organizational learning to implementation Development of post-secondary online degree programs,"Davis, K."

However, for those studying public relations the oil spill brought more than ecological disaster, by providing a case study of crisis communication. Although there were a number of crisis responses from BP throughout the course of the oil spill, the primary crisis response crafted by BP was an image restoration campaign which premiered in early June 2010. This campaign, though it exhibits qualities of a standard crisis response, was wildly unpopular with the United States Government and citizenry. This rhetorical analysis attempts to uncover the reasons behind the campaign's failure through an application of the genre model of criticism. By defining the crisis communication genre and applying it to the artifact, the current study uncovers the reasons behind the failure of the campaign. Through this discussion, this analysis identifies that BP did not address all necessary exigencies, nor did it consider the influence a rhetor can have on a message.
